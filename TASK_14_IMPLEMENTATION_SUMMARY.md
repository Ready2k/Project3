This implementation provides real-time visibility into system performance, automated quality checks, and actionable recommendations for optimization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Real-time Monitoring for Technology Extraction Accuracy âœ…

**Location:** `app/monitoring/tech_stack_monitor.py`

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time accuracy tracking** with continuous monitoring of extraction performance
- **Live metric streaming** with 30-second update intervals for immediate feedback
- **Accuracy degradation detection** with automatic alerts for rapid performance drops
- **Session-based tracking** linking accuracy metrics to specific user sessions
- **Confidence scoring** for all extracted technologies with threshold-based alerting

**Implementation Highlights:**
```python
async def _real_time_monitoring_stream(self) -> None:
    """Provide real-time monitoring stream for live updates."""
    while self.monitoring_active:
        # Monitor accuracy trends and detect rapid degradation
        if recent_trend < -0.1:  # 10% drop triggers alert
            self._create_alert(AlertLevel.WARNING, "accuracy_degradation", ...)
```

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Extraction accuracy rate (extracted vs expected technologies)
- Explicit technology inclusion rate (user-specified technologies in final stack)
- Processing time per session
