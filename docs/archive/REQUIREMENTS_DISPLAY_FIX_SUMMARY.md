# Requirements Display Fix Summary

## Problem
In the System Diagrams section, long requirement descriptions were displayed in full, forcing users to scroll extensively to reach the diagram generation controls. This created a poor user experience, especially for detailed requirements with multiple sections.

## Solution
Implemented a collapsible expander to contain the original requirements, allowing users to choose whether to view the full requirements text.

### Changes Made

**File:** `streamlit_app.py`
- **Line ~5264**: Replaced direct display of requirements with collapsible expander
- **Before:** `st.write(f"**Generating diagram for:** {requirement_text}")`
- **After:** 
  ```python
  # Show requirements in a collapsible expander to save space
  with st.expander("ðŸ“‹ View Original Requirements", expanded=False):
      st.write(requirement_text)
  ```

### Key Features
- **Collapsible Design**: Requirements are hidden by default (`expanded=False`)
- **User Choice**: Users can expand to view full requirements when needed
- **Space Efficient**: Diagram generation controls are immediately visible
- **Consistent UX**: Matches existing pattern used elsewhere in the application (line 3670)
- **Clear Labeling**: Uses descriptive title "ðŸ“‹ View Original Requirements"

### Benefits
1. **Improved Navigation**: Users can quickly access diagram generation controls
2. **Reduced Scrolling**: Long requirements no longer force excessive scrolling
3. **Optional Detail**: Users can still view full requirements when needed
4. **Better UX**: Cleaner, more organized interface
5. **Consistent Design**: Follows existing application patterns

### Testing
- âœ… Syntax validation passed
- âœ… Pattern implementation verified
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… Maintains all original information accessibility

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: No changes to data structure or API
- **UI Enhancement Only**: Pure user interface improvement
- **No Dependencies**: Uses existing Streamlit expander component

## Impact
This fix significantly improves the user experience in the System Diagrams section by making the interface more navigable while preserving access to all original information.
