# Pattern Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the safe removal of 12 duplicate auto-generated patterns while preserving 11 high-value manual patterns.

## Current State
- **Total Patterns**: 23
- **Target Patterns**: 11 (48% reduction)
- **Patterns to Remove**: 12 duplicates

## Patterns to KEEP (11 High-Value Patterns)

### High-Value Manual Patterns (7)
| Pattern | Name | Reason to Keep |
|---------|------|----------------|
| PAT-001 | Legal contract summarization | Unique, manual, specialized |
| PAT-002 | Invoice processing | Foundational, manual, core functionality |
| PAT-003 | Multilingual support | Original, manual, unique capability |
| PAT-004 | Brand-tone marketing | Unique, manual, specialized |
| PAT-005 | Email order extraction | Unique, manual, specialized |
| PAT-006 | PII redaction | Security-focused, manual, critical |
| PAT-009 | Enhanced golf coaching | Enhanced, unique autonomous capabilities |

### Autonomous Agent Patterns (4) - All Manual
| Pattern | Name | Reason to Keep |
|---------|------|----------------|
| APAT-001 | Legal contract analysis agent | Manual, autonomous version |
| APAT-002 | Invoice processing agent | Manual, autonomous version |
| APAT-003 | Customer support agent | Manual, autonomous version |
| APAT-004 | Payment dispute agent | Manual, autonomous version |

## Patterns to REMOVE (12 Duplicates)

### Golf Patterns - Remove 4, Keep PAT-009
| Pattern | Reason for Removal |
|---------|-------------------|
| PAT-010 | Auto-generated duplicate of golf functionality |
| PAT-012 | Auto-generated duplicate of golf functionality |
| PAT-015 | Auto-generated duplicate of golf functionality |
| PAT-016 | Auto-generated duplicate of golf functionality |

### Invoice/Payment Patterns - Remove 5, Keep PAT-002 & APAT-002
| Pattern | Reason for Removal |
|---------|-------------------|
| PAT-011 | Auto-generated invoice variation |
| PAT-013 | Auto-generated invoice variation |
| PAT-014 | Auto-generated invoice variation |
| PAT-017 | Auto-generated invoice variation |
| PAT-020 | Duplicate of APAT-004 functionality |

### Customer Support Patterns - Remove 2, Keep PAT-003 & APAT-003
| Pattern | Reason for Removal |
|---------|-------------------|
| PAT-007 | Auto-generated duplicate of PAT-003 |
| PAT-019 | Auto-generated generic messaging |

### Other Auto-Generated - Remove 1
| Pattern | Reason for Removal |
|---------|-------------------|
| PAT-008 | Auto-generated simple card replacement |

## Cleanup Criteria

### Keep Patterns That Are:
- ✅ **Manually created** with human curation
- ✅ **Unique functionality** not duplicated elsewhere
- ✅ **High autonomy scores** (95-98% for APAT patterns)
- ✅ **Foundational patterns** that others build upon
- ✅ **Security-critical** or compliance-related
- ✅ **Enhanced versions** with additional capabilities

### Remove Patterns That Are:
- ❌ **Auto-generated** without human review
- ❌ **Duplicates** of existing functionality
- ❌ **Generic variations** without unique value
- ❌ **Simple replacements** of existing patterns
- ❌ **Conceptually similar** to kept patterns

## Safety Measures

### Backup Strategy
- All removed patterns are backed up with timestamp
- Backup format: `.deleted_{pattern_name}_{timestamp}.json`
- Backups stored in same directory for easy recovery

### Validation Steps
1. **Pre-cleanup validation** of all pattern files
2. **Confirmation prompt** before any deletions
3. **Individual pattern validation** before removal
4. **Post-cleanup verification** of remaining patterns
5. **Summary report** of cleanup results

## Expected Results

### Before Cleanup
- 23 total patterns
- Mix of manual and auto-generated
- Significant duplication in golf, invoice, and support patterns

### After Cleanup
- 11 high-value patterns (48% reduction)
- All remaining patterns are manually curated
- Clear separation between traditional (PAT-*) and autonomous (APAT-*) patterns
- Improved pattern library quality and maintainability

## Running the Cleanup

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
python scripts/cleanup_duplicate_patterns.py

# The script will:
# 1. Show current state and planned changes
# 2. Ask for confirmation
# 3. Create backups of all removed patterns
# 4. Remove duplicate patterns
# 5. Provide summary report
```

## Recovery Process

If you need to recover any removed pattern:

```bash
# List available backups
ls data/patterns/.deleted_*

# Restore a specific pattern
cp data/patterns/.deleted_PAT-010_1234567890.json data/patterns/PAT-010.json
```

## Quality Assurance

After cleanup, the pattern library will have:
- **Higher quality**: Only manually curated patterns
- **Better organization**: Clear PAT-* vs APAT-* distinction
- **Reduced maintenance**: Fewer duplicate patterns to maintain
- **Improved performance**: Faster pattern loading and matching
- **Enhanced user experience**: Less confusion from duplicate recommendations
