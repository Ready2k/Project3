```sql
CREATE TABLE security_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    total_requests INTEGER NOT NULL,
    blocked_requests INTEGER NOT NULL,
    flagged_requests INTEGER NOT NULL,

## Security Metrics Collected

### Real-time Metrics
- Total requests processed
- Blocked, flagged, and passed request counts
- Average processing time per request
- Detection rate (percentage of requests flagged/blocked)
- Attack pattern frequency distribution
- Progressive response level distribution

### Historical Analytics
- Attack statistics by time window (24h, 7d, 30d, all time)
- Top attack patterns detected
- Detector performance metrics
- False positive tracking
- Progressive response effectiveness

## Alert System

### Alert Severity Determination
- **CRITICAL**: Block action with >95% confidence
- **HIGH**: Block action with >80% confidence
- **MEDIUM**: Block action with <80% confidence or Flag action with >80% confidence
- **LOW**: Flag action with <80% confidence

### Alert Callbacks
- Pluggable alert callback system
- Support for both sync and async callbacks
- Automatic error handling for callback failures
- Recent alerts tracking (last 1000 alerts)
