# Agent Team Display Coordination Fix

## Problem

There was a mismatch between the Agent Interaction Flow diagram and the Agent Team composition display:

- **Agent Interaction Flow** showed: "Complex Multi-Agent Workflow (5 agents) - User Request → **Coordinator** → Specialist Agents → Integration → Comprehensive Solution"
- **Meet Your Agent Team** showed: "5 agents total • **0 Coordinators** • 1 Specialist • 4 Support Agents"

This inconsistency was confusing because the flow diagram claimed there was a coordinator, but the team composition showed zero coordinators.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Flow Description**: The `_render_agent_interaction_flow()` method had hardcoded text that always mentioned a "Coordinator" for complex multi-agent workflows (>3 agents), regardless of whether a coordinator agent actually existed.

2. **Missing Specialist Keywords**: The agent categorization logic was missing "analytics" as a specialist keyword, so "Analytics Agent" was being categorized as a support agent instead of a specialist.

3. **Disconnect Between Systems**: The multi-agent designer correctly creates "Coordinator Agent" when using hierarchical architecture, but the interaction flow display didn't check if coordinators actually existed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Interaction Flow Logic

Updated `_render_agent_interaction_flow()` in `streamlit_app.py` to dynamically check for coordinator agents:

```python
# Check if we actually have a coordinator agent
has_coordinator = any(
    any(keyword in self._extract_agent_name(role).lower() 
        for keyword in ['coordinator', 'manager', 'orchestrator', 'supervisor'])
    for role in agent_roles_found
)

if has_coordinator:
    # Show hierarchical workflow with coordinator
    st.markdown(f"""
    **Complex Multi-Agent Workflow** ({len(agent_roles_found)} agents)
    
    `User Request` → **Coordinator** → **Specialist Agents** → **Integration** → `Comprehensive Solution`
    
    *Hierarchical coordination with parallel processing and intelligent task distribution.*
    """)
else:
    # Show collaborative workflow instead
    agent_names = [self._extract_agent_name(role) for role in agent_roles_found[:3]]
    if len(agent_names) > 3:
        agent_display = f"{', '.join(agent_names[:2])}, and {len(agent_roles_found)-2} other agents"
    else:
        agent_display = ' → '.join(agent_names)
    
    st.markdown(f"""
    **Collaborative Multi-Agent Workflow** ({len(agent_roles_found)} agents)
    
    `User Request` → **{agent_display}** → **Integration** → `Comprehensive Solution`
    
    *Collaborative processing with specialized agents working in parallel and coordination.*
    """)
```

### 2. Enhanced Specialist Keywords

Added "analytics" to the specialist categorization keywords:

```python
elif any(keyword in role_lower for keyword in ['specialist', 'expert', 'analyst', 'analytics', 'negotiator']):
    specialist_agents.append(role)
```

This ensures that "Analytics Agent" is properly categorized as a specialist rather than support.

## Test Results

Created comprehensive tests that verify:

### Test Case 1: Hierarchical System with Coordinator
- **Input**: 5 agents including "Coordinator Agent"
- **Expected**: 1 Coordinator, 1 Specialist, 3 Support
- **Flow**: "Complex Multi-Agent Workflow" with coordinator
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Test Case 2: Collaborative System without Coordinator  
- **Input**: 5 agents with no coordinator keywords
- **Expected**: 0 Coordinators, 1 Specialist, 4 Support
- **Flow**: "Collaborative Multi-Agent Workflow" 
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Test Case 3: Single Agent System
- **Input**: 1 agent
- **Expected**: 0 Coordinators, 0 Specialists, 1 Support
- **Flow**: Single agent workflow
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

## Impact

✅ **Consistency**: Agent Interaction Flow now accurately reflects the actual team composition

✅ **Accuracy**: "Analytics Agent" is correctly categorized as a specialist

✅ **User Experience**: No more confusing mismatches between flow description and team composition

✅ **Flexibility**: System now handles both hierarchical (with coordinator) and collaborative (without coordinator) multi-agent architectures

✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified

- `streamlit_app.py`: Updated `_render_agent_interaction_flow()` method and specialist keywords

## Best Practices Applied

- **Dynamic Logic**: Check actual data instead of making assumptions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test multiple scenarios to ensure robustness
- **Clear Categorization**: Use appropriate keywords for agent role classification
- **User-Friendly Display**: Provide accurate and helpful information to users
- **Consistency**: Ensure all parts of the UI tell the same story

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding more specialist keywords as new agent types are generated
- Monitor for other potential mismatches between different UI components
- Ensure multi-agent designer and agentic recommendation service stay in sync
