  "description": "Fully autonomous AI agent that fully autonomous ai agent that handles customer support tickets end-to-end across multiple languages and channels. the agent uses advanced reasoning to understand complex issues, accesses knowledge bases and system apis to investigate problems, implements solutions directly, and follows up to ensure resolution. resolves 95% of tickets autonomously through sophisticated problem-solving and system integration capabilities.",
