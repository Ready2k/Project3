  "name": "AI Golf-Swing Analysis and Personalized Coaching Pipeline",
  "description": "End-to-end software pipeline that captures video and sensor data of a golfer&#x27;s swing, performs computer-vision and kinematics analysis, generates personalized corrective drills and practice plans targeted to reduce handicap, and delivers real-time and post-session feedback via mobile/web. The pattern covers on-device or cloud-based pose estimation, swing segmentation, feature extraction (club path, clubface angle, tempo, rotation), ML-based fault detection and skill-level progression modeling, an adaptive recommender for drills and practice schedules, session logging, progress analytics, and optional human coach review workflows.",

Provide per-swing feedback and a short drill recommendation. Store anonymized session metadata and opt-in video uploads for further model training. Phase 2 (Personalization &amp; Scale): Aggregate labeled sessions, train supervised models to predict swing faults and a progression model to recommend drills and practice schedules personalized by learning rate. Add on-device inference for low-latency feedback, cloud retraining pipelines, and a coach dashboard for human review and issuing advanced drills. Phase 3 (Optimization &amp; Validation): Run controlled user studies to correlate practice adherence with handicap improvement; iterate models and UX. Implement role-based access, privacy controls, retention policies, and consent flows. Maintain test harnesses (synthetic/simulated swings) and CI for continuous model validation. Keep human-in-loop workflows for ambiguous cases and coach sign-offs for advanced recommendations.",
