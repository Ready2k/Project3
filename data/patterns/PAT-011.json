  "name": "Email-to-BACS Invoice Validation and Payment Assist",
  "description": "Automates ingestion of daily invoice emails and attachments, extracts invoice data (supplier, line items, amounts, invoice number, due date), reconciles and validates that data against the user&#x27;s Excel-based ledger, surfaces mismatches for human review, and\u2014after explicit approval\u2014initiates BACS payments via HSBC (API or secure BACS file upload). Keeps an auditable trail and updates the ledger automatically (or exports an updated Excel/Google Sheet). The pattern emphasizes a human-in-loop approval step for financial control while automating repetitive extraction, validation, and payment orchestration tasks.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discover &amp; stabilize inputs: inventory typical invoice formats, current Excel schema, and obtain HSBC sandbox access. 2) Ingest emails: implement IMAP or provider API connector to pick invoices and store attachments. 3) Extract data: use a managed Document AI (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer / Google Document AI) for higher accuracy; fallback to Tesseract for MVP. Validate extracted fields (supplier, invoice number, date, amount, sort code/account, BACS reference). 4) Normalize &amp; reconcile: map extracted fields into a canonical invoice model; reconcile against the Excel ledger (recommend migrating to Google Sheets or a small DB to simplify programmatic updates). Flag mismatches (amount differences, missing supplier data, duplicate invoices) and group straightforward matches for bulk approval. 5) Human-in-loop approval: present a compact review UI or approve via secure email/Teams link. Require two-factor approvals for payments above thresholds. 6) Payment orchestration: on approval, either (preferred) call HSBC Business API to submit BACS Direct Credit or (alternative) generate bank-compatible BACS file and upload via SFTP/EBICS to HSBC or hand off to bank bureau. Record payment reference and [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]ledger. 7) Auditing &amp; monitoring: store immutable audit records for each invoice, extraction confidence scores, approver identity, timestamp, and payment confirmation. 8) Hardening: add rate-limiting, retry logic, anomaly detection for unusual payments, and scheduled reconciliation jobs. 9) Compliance &amp; handover: document procedures, run penetration tests, and train approvers. Keep human oversight permanently for any high-risk cases.",
