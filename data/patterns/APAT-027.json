  "description": "Multi-agent system with 4 specialized agents for **Business Requirement:**\nAutomate our customer support system to handle complex multi-step customer inquiries that require reasoning, decision-making, and adaptive responses. The system needs to analyze customer emails, understand context and sentiment, research our knowledge base and product documentation, make intelligent decisions about escalation, generate personalized responses, and learn from interactions to improve over time.\n\n**Key Capabilities Needed:**\n- Natural language understanding of customer inquiries with context awareness\n- Intelligent routing based on complexity, urgency, and customer history\n- Dynamic knowledge retrieval from multiple sources (FAQ, documentation, previous tickets)\n- Reasoning about solutions and generating step-by-step troubleshooting guides\n- Sentiment analysis and emotional intelligence in responses\n- Autonomous decision-making for escalation to human agents\n- Personalization based on customer profile and interaction history\n- Continuous learning from successful resolution patterns\n- Multi-turn conversation handling with memory of previous interactions\n- Integration with CRM, ticketing system, and knowledge management platforms\n\n**Complexity Factors:**\n- Handles ambiguous and incomplete customer requests\n- Requires understanding of business context and policies\n- Must adapt communication style based on customer type (technical vs non-technical)\n- Needs to make judgment calls about when human intervention is required\n- Should proactively suggest related solutions and preventive measures\n- Must handle edge cases and exceptions gracefully\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- 80% reduction in human agent workload for routine inquiries\n- Improved response consistency and quality\n- 24/7 availability with intelligent escalation",
