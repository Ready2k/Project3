  "name": "Email-to-Payments Invoice Validation and Payment Orchestration (NatWest)",
  "description": "Automates ingestion of daily invoice emails, extracts and validates invoice data against the user&#x27;s existing Excel spreadsheet, and orchestrates payments through NatWest online (preferably via Open Banking APIs, with secure RPA/browser automation as a fallback). The system flags mismatches and provides a human-in-loop approval UI for paying validated invoices, logs all actions for audit/reconciliation, and updates the Excel source (or canonical DB) after payment or exception resolution.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery: catalog sample invoice formats, gather Excel structure and approval rules, and confirm NatWest access options (Open Banking API availability vs only web UI). 2) Architecture: event-driven pipeline triggered on new invoice email -&gt; ingestion service -&gt; OCR/NLP extractor -&gt; validation engine (rules matching Excel or canonical DB) -&gt; decision router. 3) Validation &amp; Human Approval: surface validated invoices in a minimal web dashboard or messaging approval flow with approve/reject and change fields capability. 4) Payment Execution: implement Open Banking Payments API integration (preferred) with OAuth2 consent flow; if unavailable, implement an RPA-based payment executor (Playwright/Robocorp) that operates in a restricted, monitored environment and requires manual MFA where necessary. 5) Post-payment: [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]Excel (via Microsoft Graph) or canonical DB, [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]reconciliation record, send confirmations, and store immutable audit logs. 6) Security &amp; Compliance: store all secrets in a vault, enforce role-based access, use TLS, log all actions for audit, and implement rate limiting and retry policies. 7) Testing &amp; Rollout: pilot with low volume, tune extraction rules, iterate on exception workflows, then expand. Emphasize human-in-loop approval for first 2-3 months before transitioning more actions to automation.",
