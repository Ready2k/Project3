  "name": "AI Golf Swing Analysis and Digital Coaching Agent",
  "description": "Automates digital analysis of a golfer&#x27;s swing from smartphone or wearable sensor inputs, generates personalized corrective recommendations, practice drills and a progressive training plan, and autonomously manages session scheduling, feedback delivery, and ongoing model-driven adjustments. The agentic system performs video/IMU ingestion, pose estimation, feature extraction, similarity scoring against model swings, generates actionable coaching instructions (text/visual/AR overlays), and plans practice schedules. Human coach review is optional for higher-assurance corrections and competition-level coaching.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) MVP scope: Implement an on-demand pipeline where users upload smartphone videos (front and side views) and optionally IMU logs. Use MediaPipe/OpenPose to extract keypoints and compute swing features (clubhead speed proxy, shoulder rotation, hip rotation, swing plane, angle of attack). Build baseline models to classify common faults and match to corrective drills. Ship a mobile/web UI for uploads and deliver concise text+video+annotated overlay feedback. Agent capabilities: reason over user history to propose weekly practice plans, schedule practice reminders, and adapt difficulty based on measured progress. 2) Human-in-loop: include a coach review workflow where flagged swings with low confidence are routed for manual review \u2014 this increases reliability and provides labeled examples for model improvement. 3) Scale and enhance: add IMU/club sensor fusion, personalize models via transfer learning, add real-time feedback (WebRTC + on-device TFLite inference) and AR overlays for live guidance. 4) Instrumentation &amp; ML Ops: use MLflow/W&amp;B for experiments, automated retraining pipelines, and continuous evaluation metrics (accuracy of fault detection, improvement in kinematic KPIs, user engagement). 5) Privacy &amp; UX: provide clear consent, in-app controls for retention and sharing, local on-device inference option for privacy-sensitive users. 6) Agent orchestration: use a planner (LangChain or custom) to [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]multi-step coaching plans, manage retraining jobs, and coordinate notifications, calendar invites, and coach escalations. Note: because the user must physically perform swings and high-assurance coaching may need human oversight, this design is Partially Automatable.",
