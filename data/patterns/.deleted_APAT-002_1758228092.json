  "description": "Fully autonomous AI agent that fully autonomous ai agent that processes invoices end-to-end, from receipt through payment authorization. the agent uses computer vision for document analysis, applies business rules reasoning, negotiates payment terms, resolves discrepancies through vendor communication, and makes payment decisions within authority limits. handles 98% of invoices without human intervention through sophisticated exception reasoning.",
