  "name": "Autonomous Legal Contract Analysis Agent",
  "description": "Fully autonomous AI agent that analyzes legal contracts, extracts key clauses, identifies risks, negotiates terms within predefined parameters, and makes approval/rejection decisions based on legal reasoning frameworks. The agent uses multi-step reasoning to understand contract implications, applies legal precedents, and autonomously handles 95% of contract reviews without human intervention.",
