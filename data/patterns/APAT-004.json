  "name": "Autonomous Payment Dispute Resolution Agent",
  "description": "Fully autonomous AI agent that handles end-to-end payment dispute resolution through self-service channels. The agent autonomously processes dispute submissions, applies codified decision matrices, communicates with customers, coordinates with multiple systems (Salesforce, payment processors, vendors), and manages the complete dispute lifecycle including outcome delivery and follow-up. Achieves 95% autonomous resolution without human intervention through sophisticated reasoning and decision-making capabilities.",
