  "name": "Email-to-Payments Invoice Processing with RPA Bank Portal Execution",
  "description": "Automates ingestion of daily invoice emails, extracts structured invoice data (OCR + ML/NLP), validates line items and vendor/payee details against the user&#x27;s Excel ledger, routes exceptions to a human reviewer, and executes payments on a bank web portal via RPA when validation and approval criteria are met. Stores audit trails and updates the original spreadsheet/ledger automatically.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery: inventory invoice types, vendor master data, current Excel schema, and bank portal login/MFA method. 2) Ingestion: route vendor emails to a dedicated mailbox; implement connector using Microsoft Graph or IMAP. 3) Extraction: run attachments through Document AI/Textract for structured fields; augment with rule-based/NLP models for missing fields. 4) Normalization &amp; validation: map fields to canonical schema, validate totals, tax, PO matching, duplicate detection, and vendor account validation against vendor master and Excel ledger. 5) Risk scoring &amp; approval: compute auto-approve rules (e.g., below threshold, valid vendor, exact ledger match). Send exceptions and high-risk items to human approvers via a lightweight dashboard or Slack/email approval flow. 6) Payment execution: prefer bank API/Open Banking if available. If only web portal exists, implement RPA flow with explicit checkpoints and human OTP/MFA input step. Use headless automation frameworks (UiPath or Playwright) with robust selectors and retries. 7) Post-payment actions: capture confirmation, [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]Excel/ledger and accounting system, generate audit record and receipts, send notification to initiator. 8) Security &amp; operations: secrets in Vault/KMS, TLS for all comms, immutable audit logs, role-based access control, and alerts for failed payments. 9) Maintenance: scheduled retraining/tuning of parsers, RPA flow monitoring, and document format onboarding process.",
