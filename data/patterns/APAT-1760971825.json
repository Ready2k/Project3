  "description": "Multi-agent system with 4 specialized agents for Scenario: Proactive Investment Rebalancing\nAs a retail investor\nI want the agent to monitor my portfolio and automatically rebalance it when market movements or my risk profile change\nSo that my investments stay aligned with my goals and risk tolerance\nBusiness value: Improves portfolio performance and reduces manual effort.\nAssumptions:\nThe agent has access to live market data, portfolio holdings, and customer risk profile.\nIt can execute trades through the investment platformâ€™s trading API once I approve the plan.\nAcceptance criteria:\nGiven portfolio and market data\nWhen asset allocation drifts more than 5% from the target\nThen the agent proposes a rebalance plan showing affected assets, trade amounts, and expected impact\nGiven I approve the plan\nWhen market hours are open\nThen the agent executes trades through the trading API and records all actions in the audit log\nGiven my risk profile changes\nThen the agent updates the target allocation and recalculates the plan automatically\nNon-functional / Controls:\nReal-time data feed (latency &amp;lt; 2 s).\nAll trade decisions logged with model version, policy version, and timestamp.\nPSD2/SCA for trade approvals.\nHuman-in-loop only if trade exceeds regulatory or internal limits.",
