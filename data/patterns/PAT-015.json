  "name": "AI Golf Swing Coaching and Handicap Reduction Automation",
  "description": "Automates digital golf-swing analysis, personalized practice-plan generation, progress tracking, and coach-assisted review to reduce a player&#x27;s handicap. The agentic system ingests user-submitted swing videos and optional sensor/club data, runs pose estimation and swing-metric extraction (clubhead speed, tempo, swing plane, face angle, sequencing), diagnoses key faults, synthesizes prioritized drills and session plans, schedules practice reminders, and tracks KPI-driven progress toward handicap reduction. The system uses automated reasoning and planning to propose week-by-week routines and dynamically adapts plans based on performance; a human coach review loop is included for final validation and safety/explainability of instruction.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery &amp; data collection: define required outputs (metrics that correlate to handicap reduction: clubhead speed, ball launch, dispersion, tempo, attack angle). Collect initial dataset: volunteer users + coach annotated swings and any available sensor data. 2) MVP pipeline: implement video ingestion, keypoint extraction (MediaPipe/OpenPose), derive heuristic metrics (joint angles, sequencing, tempo). Build rule-based diagnostic engine to map metric thresholds to prioritized drills. Expose APIs and a simple mobile/web uploader and dashboard. 3) Human-in-loop: include coach review UI so a certified coach can accept/adjust automated diagnoses and drill plans (required to prevent poor advice). Mark feasibility as Partially Automatable due to coach oversight. 4) ML iteration: train supervised models to predict swing faults and ball outcomes from pose + sensor features; add personalization layer that models user improvement curves and adapt plans. 5) Feedback &amp; planning: implement an agentic planner that reasons over user schedule, fatigue, and progress to generate weekly practice plans and micro-goals; allow user overrides. 6) Integrations: add optional sensor/club provider APIs (Arccos, TrackMan, Garmin), calendar and push notifications for reminders. 7) Monitoring &amp; continuous learning: capture outcomes after drills, retrain models periodically, maintain audit logs and model explainability for each recommendation. 8) Deployment &amp; safety: enforce consent, store PII encrypted, surface uncertainty/confidence with each automated recommendation and require coach sign-off for high-risk changes. Start with on_demand batch analysis; roadmap to optional real-time feedback via WebRTC.",
