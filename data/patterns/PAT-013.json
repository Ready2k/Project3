  "description": "Automates ingestion of vendor invoices received by email, extracts invoice data (PDF/attachments), validates line-items and totals against rules and the user&#x27;s existing Excel records, presents exceptions for human review, and upon explicit approval, executes BACS payments via HSBC Business/Payments API. Uses an LLM/agent for classification, anomaly detection suggestions and to draft summaries for approvers; uses robust secrets management, audit logging, and reconciliation feeds to ensure end-to-end traceability.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery &amp; samples: collect representative invoices, Excel template/schema, supplier list and business validation rules. 2) Ingestion: implement email connector (IMAP or Microsoft Graph) to stream emails to a processing queue. 3) Parsing: pipe attachments through an extraction pipeline (PDF parsing + OCR + ML-based invoice field extraction). Use templated rules and ML entity extraction for line-items, totals, VAT, invoice number, supplier name, due date. 4) Enrichment &amp; validation: compare parsed invoice to supplier master and the Excel ledger (or sync Excel into DB). Implement rule engine for validation (amount tolerance, duplicate invoices, PO matching). 5) Agentic assistance: use an LLM as an assistant to classify uncertain fields, produce a human-readable summary, and propose a recommended action (pay, hold, query). Clearly mark confidence and reasoning. 6) Human review UI: show concise summary, highlight discrepancies, provide approve/decline/query buttons. Allow mobile/Slack/email approvals with strong authentication. 7) Payment execution: after explicit approval, call HSBC BACS API using secure credentials stored in a vault. Use two-step confirmation for &gt;X amounts. Log request/response and persist payment records. 8) Reconciliation: ingest bank confirmations or statements (API or MT940) to reconcile payments back to invoices and [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]Excel/DB. 9) Ops &amp; security: centralize secrets, enforce TLS, role-based access control, full audit logs, and monitoring/alerting for failures. 10) Testing &amp; rollout: unit/integration tests, HSBC sandbox verification, run in parallel (shadow mode) before enabling live payments. Emphasize human-in-loop controls for at least an initial period to reduce risk.",
