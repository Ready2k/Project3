  "name": "Email-to-Payment Accounts Payable Automation (NatWest Open Banking + Human Approval)",
  "description": "Automates daily invoice intake from email, structured data extraction, validation against user-maintained spreadsheet rules, and prepares or executes payments via a NatWest bank account. The agent fetches emails and attachments, runs OCR/NLP to extract invoice fields (supplier, amounts, dates, invoice number, line items), cross-checks against the Excel/Google Sheet (vendor list, expected amounts, PO matches, payment terms), flags exceptions, creates payment drafts, routes for human approval when required, executes payment through NatWest Open Banking API when safe/authorized (with an RPA browser fallback if API access is not available), and updates the spreadsheet/audit logs with payment status and reconciliation data.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery &amp; access: Inventory email provider, confirm spreadsheet location (OneDrive/Google Sheets), and request NatWest Open Banking sandbox access. Define approval thresholds and exception rules. 2) Ingestion: Build an email listener (provider API webhook or scheduled IMAP poll) that stores attachments and metadata in object storage and logs receipt. 3) Extraction: Run OCR (Document AI/Textract/Form Recognizer) and a small NLP pipeline (spaCy + rules) to extract structured fields; store parsed results in Postgres. 4) Validation: Apply deterministic validation rules against the spreadsheet (vendor checks, amount ranges, PO matching). Classify outcomes: auto-approve, auto-pay, require human approval, or reject. 5) Human-in-loop: Provide a minimal approval UI (or email approval links) summarizing key fields and highlighting mismatches; capture approval/rejection and reason. 6) Payment execution: For approved payments, call NatWest Open Banking payment endpoint (implement OAuth2/consent flows). If Open Banking access is not possible, use an authenticated RPA flow with strict guardrails as fallback (rate-limited, monitored). 7) Reconciliation &amp; update: On payment success/failure [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]the spreadsheet (via Graph API/Sheets API) and ledger (Postgres), archive invoice PDF and store audit record. 8) Monitoring &amp; security: Centralize logs, alerts for exceptions/failures, rotate secrets via Vault/KMS, encrypt data at rest/in transit, and keep an immutable audit trail for each payment. 9) Iteration: Tune OCR/NLP models and rules with supervised corrections from human reviews to reduce exception rates over time. Enforce periodic reviews of vendor allowlist and approval thresholds.",
