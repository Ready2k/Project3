  "name": "AI Golf Swing Coaching and Handicap Reduction",
  "description": "End-to-end software system that analyzes golfer swing video and sensor data, diagnoses technical flaws, generates personalized drills &amp; practice plans, and tracks measurable progress toward handicap reduction. The system combines on-device video capture, pose estimation and biomechanical feature extraction, supervised/contrastive ML models to classify swing faults and recommend corrections, a personalization engine that sequences drills and practice loads, and dashboards and mobile push/real-time guidance for the golfer. Human coach review is supported for edge cases and higher-trust recommendations.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "Phase 0 \u2014 Discovery: collect representative sample videos across handicap levels and camera angles; define measurable success metrics (stroke gain proxies, attack angle, clubface orientation, consistency metrics) and consent/retention policies. Phase 1 \u2014 MVP: implement mobile capture with guided template to ensure consistent angles; run MediaPipe on-device to extract keypoints; compute engineered biomechanical features (hip rotation, head stability, clubpath proxies); build a lightweight classifier for common faults (over-the-top, early extension, poor rotation); provide drill recommendations mapped from fault taxonomy and a basic scheduled practice plan; store anonymized features in cloud (not raw video by default) and provide progress dashboard. Phase 2 \u2014 Model improvements: collect labeled dataset, train supervised models (TensorFlow/PyTorch) and IMU-video fusion models where sensors available; add personalization/teacher models that adapt drill sequencing based on learner response and fatigue. Phase 3 \u2014 Production &amp; human-in-loop: add coach review queue for low-confidence cases, integrate human feedback into model retraining pipelines, build subscription/payment &amp; scheduling integrations, A/B test recommendation efficacy, add longitudinal analytics to measure handicap improvement. Ops &amp; Privacy: encrypt data at rest &amp; transit, implement consent UI, retention &amp; deletion controls, logging &amp; anomaly detection, and monitoring for model drift. Metrics: per-session fault detection accuracy, drill completion rate, change in measured swing KPIs, longitudinal handicap proxy improvements. Start with privacy-by-design to avoid storing raw videos unless strictly required and consented.",
