  "name": "AI Golf Swing Coaching and Handicap Reduction Automation",
  "description": "Provides an AI-driven digital golf coaching system that analyzes user swing video and sensor data, produces personalized drills and practice plans, tracks progress toward handicap reduction, and optionally routes ambiguous cases to human coaches. The pattern covers mobile capture (live or recorded), cloud-based computer vision and ML analysis (pose estimation, kinematic feature extraction, swing-phase classification), rule-based and learned feedback mapping to corrective drills, practice scheduling, and progress metrics tied to handicap estimation. Integrations include optional launch monitor data import (CSV/API), wearable IMU via Bluetooth/phone sensors, and analytics/notification systems.",

  "llm_recommended_approach": "1) Discovery &amp; data collection: define required inputs (video angles, distance, frame rate), obtain consent templates, and instrument a small cohort to collect labeled swings (coach-reviewed). 2) MVP scope: mobile app for on-demand video upload + backend pipeline that runs pose estimation (MediaPipe), extracts kinematic features (hip rotation, shoulder turn, clubhead speed estimate), applies rule-based diagnostics (e.g., early extension, over-the-top), and returns prioritized corrective drills and a simple practice plan. Include progress tracking (shot-level and session-level) and basic handicap projection. 3) Automation &amp; ML: train supervised models to classify swing faults and estimate ball/club metrics where launch monitor data is available. Use a recommender to personalize drills based on user profile and response history. 4) Human-in-loop: route low-confidence or edge cases to a coach dashboard for review and personalized notes; use coach feedback to augment training data. 5) Real-time enhancement: add WebRTC-based live feedback with lightweight on-device pose estimation for low latency. 6) Measurement &amp; iteration: A/B test drill effectiveness, track handicap trajectory, retention, and adjust algorithms. 7) Production: secure cloud storage, automated pipelines for model retraining, monitoring, and privacy-preserving retention policies.",
