# Task 10 Implementation Summary: Requirement Context Prioritization Logic

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive requirement context prioritization logic for technology selection, addressing all requirements from 5.1 to 5.5. The implementation provides intelligent context-aware prioritization, ambiguity detection, conflict resolution, and user preference learning.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components Implemented

#### RequirementContextPrioritizer Class
- **Location**: `app/services/requirement_parsing/context_prioritizer.py`
- **Purpose**: Main class implementing context prioritization logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Context weight calculation system for different requirement sources
  - Domain-specific technology preference logic
  - Requirement ambiguity detection and clarification system
  - Context-based tie-breaking for technology selection conflicts
  - User preference learning and adaptation mechanisms

#### Supporting Data Classes
- **RequirementSource**: Enum defining priority levels for different requirement sources
- **ContextPriority**: Enum for context element priority levels
- **AmbiguityType**: Enum for different types of requirement ambiguity
- **RequirementWeight**: Configuration for requirement source weights
- **ContextWeight**: Weight calculation for technology context
- **AmbiguityDetection**: Detected ambiguity with resolution suggestions
- **UserPreference**: User preference learning data structure

### 2. Context Weight Calculation System

#### Multi-Source Weight Configuration
```python
source_weights = {
    RequirementSource.EXPLICIT_USER_INPUT: base_weight=1.0,
    RequirementSource.BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS: base_weight=0.8,
    RequirementSource.TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS: base_weight=0.7,
    RequirementSource.PATTERN_INFERENCE: base_weight=0.5,
    RequirementSource.SYSTEM_DEFAULTS: base_weight=0.3
}
```

#### Weight Components
- **Base Priority**: From requirement source (0.3-1.0)
- **Domain Boost**: Domain-specific technology preferences (+0.1 to +0.3)
- **Ecosystem Boost**: Cloud ecosystem consistency (+0.15)
- **User Preference Boost**: Learned user preferences (+0.0 to +0.1)
- **Final Weight**: Bounded sum of all components (0.0-1.0)

### 3. Domain-Specific Technology Preferences

#### Supported Domains
- **data_processing**: Apache Spark, Kafka, Pandas (AWS/GCP preferred)
- **web_api**: FastAPI, Express.js, Spring Boot (All clouds)
- **ml_ai**: OpenAI API, Transformers, LangChain (AWS/GCP preferred)
- **automation**: Celery, Kafka, RabbitMQ (AWS/Azure preferred)
- **monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger (AWS/GCP preferred)
- **security**: Vault, OAuth 2.0, JWT (AWS/Azure preferred)

#### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Must include (weight boost +0.3)
- **High**: Strong preference (weight boost +0.2)
- **Medium**: Moderate preference (weight boost +0.1)

### 4. Ambiguity Detection System

#### Detected Ambiguity Types
1. **Technology Conflicts**: Conflicting technology mentions
2. **Ecosystem Mismatches**: Mixed cloud provider references
3. **Incomplete Specifications**: Vague technology requirements
4. **Contradictory Requirements**: Conflicting system characteristics
5. **Unclear Domain**: Ambiguous application domain

#### Pattern Matching
- Regex-based pattern detection for each ambiguity type
- Confidence scoring for detected ambiguities
- Impact level assessment (high/medium/low)
- Automated clarification suggestions

#### Example Detections
- "both MySQL and PostgreSQL" → Technology Conflict
- "AWS Lambda but also Azure Functions" → Ecosystem Mismatch
- "need some database solution" → Incomplete Specification
- "simple but enterprise-grade" → Contradictory Requirements

### 5. Context-Based Conflict Resolution

#### Resolution Strategy
1. **Score Technologies**: Based on context weights and ecosystem preference
2. **Select Winner**: Highest scoring technology in conflict group
3. **Provide Reasoning**: Explain selection rationale
4. **Suggest Alternatives**: Offer compatible alternatives

#### Conflict Resolution Logic
```python
def resolve_conflicts(conflicts, tech_context):
    for conflict in conflicts:
        tech_scores = calculate_context_scores(conflict.technologies)
        winner = max(tech_scores, key=tech_scores.get)
        return resolution_with_reasoning(winner, tech_scores)
```

### 6. User Preference Learning

#### Learning Mechanism
- **Selection Tracking**: Count technology selections per domain
- **Rejection Tracking**: Count technology rejections per domain
- **Preference Scoring**: Calculate preference based on selection ratio
- **Context Patterns**: Associate preferences with usage patterns
- **Temporal Tracking**: Track when preferences were last updated

#### Preference Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_preference_score(preference):
    total_interactions = selection_count + rejection_count
    selection_ratio = selection_count / total_interactions
    confidence = min(total_interactions / 10.0, 1.0)
    raw_score = (selection_ratio - 0.5) * 2.0  # Range: -1.0 to 1.0
    return raw_score * confidence
```

#### Adaptation Mechanism
- Preferences influence future technology weights (+/- 0.1 weight adjustment)
- Domain-specific learning (separate preferences per domain)
- Confidence-based weighting (more interactions = higher confidence)

### 7. Integration with Tech Stack Generator

#### Enhanced Generation Flow
1. **Parse Requirements**: Extract explicit technologies and context
2. **Build Context**: Create comprehensive technology context
3. **Calculate Weights**: Apply context prioritization logic
4. **Detect Ambiguities**: Identify and resolve conflicts

6. **Generate Stack**: Create context-aware technology recommendations

#### New Methods Added
