## SSL Fix Validation Tests ✅

### Implementation
Created validation tests to ensure the fix works correctly:

1. **SSL setting respected across all auth methods** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests username/password, email/API token, and PAT authentication
   - Verifies consistent SSL configuration across all auth types

2. **SSL configuration propagation consistency** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests SSL configuration with custom CA certificates
   - Verifies consistent propagation to all components

3. **No duplicate SSL configuration assignments** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that the duplicate configuration fix is working

- ✅ **Requirement 2.3**: SSL handler receives correct configuration

## Comprehensive Validation Script ✅

### Implementation
Created `test_ssl_verification_fix_validation.py` that validates:

1. **SSL configuration propagation** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests SSL disabled and enabled configurations
   - Verifies consistent propagation to all components

2. **SSL verification can be disabled** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests SSL handler with verification disabled
   - Confirms httpx configuration respects settings

3. **SSL setting respected across auth methods** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests all three authentication methods
   - Verifies consistent SSL behavior

4. **No duplicate configuration assignments** - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that duplicate configuration fix is working

## Conclusion

The JIRA SSL verification fix has been thoroughly tested and validated. All requirements are met, and the implementation provides:

1. ✅ **Reliable SSL verification control** - Users can successfully disable SSL verification for self-signed certificates
2. ✅ **Consistent behavior** - SSL settings work the same across all authentication methods
3. ✅ **Clean implementation** - No duplicate configuration assignments
4. ✅ **Immediate effect** - SSL setting changes take effect right away
5. ✅ **Comprehensive feedback** - Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
6. ✅ **Security awareness** - Appropriate warnings and user education

The fix successfully addresses the original issue where the "Verify SSL Certificates" setting was being ignored, allowing users to connect to JIRA servers with self-signed certificates or internal CA certificates when needed.
