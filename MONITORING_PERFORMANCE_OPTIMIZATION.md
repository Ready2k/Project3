# Monitoring System Performance Optimization

## üö® Quick Fix for High CPU Usage

If you're experiencing high CPU usage (>80%) from the monitoring system, run this immediately:

```bash
python apply_monitoring_optimizations.py
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Automatically detect your system's performance level
- ‚úÖ Apply appropriate optimizations
- ‚úÖ Reduce monitoring frequencies
- ‚úÖ Optimize memory usage
- ‚úÖ Create optimized configuration files

## üìä Current Issue

The monitoring system was showing CPU usage warnings:
```
cpu_percent max threshold violated: 83.6 > 80.0
```

This indicates the monitoring components are consuming too many resources.

## üîß What the Optimization Does

### Immediate Optimizations Applied:
1. **Reduced Update Frequencies**:
   - Real-time updates: 30s ‚Üí 60s
   - Quality checks: 5min ‚Üí 10min
   - Analytics: 15min ‚Üí 30min
   - Health checks: 5min ‚Üí 10min

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Reduced data retention periods
   - Limited in-memory data structures
   - Enabled data compression
   - Optimized garbage collection

3. **CPU Optimization**:
   - Reduced background task frequency
   - Enabled task batching
   - Implemented adaptive scheduling
   - Added task prioritization

4. **Adaptive Performance**:
   - Automatic optimization level adjustment
   - Emergency mode for critical situations
   - Performance monitoring and alerts
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment

## üìà Performance Levels

### Normal (CPU < 70%, Memory < 80%)
- Standard monitoring intervals
- Full feature set enabled
- Normal data retention

### Optimized (CPU 70-85%, Memory 80-90%)
- 1.5x longer intervals
- Reduced data retention
- Some non-critical features disabled

### Emergency (CPU > 85%, Memory > 90%)
- 3x longer intervals
- Aggressive data cleanup
- Only critical monitoring active

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual configuration, edit these files:

### 1. Main Configuration (`config/monitoring_optimization.yaml`)
```yaml
performance_optimizer:
  cpu_threshold_warning: 70.0
  cpu_threshold_critical: 85.0
  
monitoring_components:
  tech_stack_monitor:
    quality_check_interval: 600  # 10 minutes
    real_time_update_interval: 60  # 1 minute
```

### 2. Component-Specific Settings
```python
# In your monitoring setup
from app.monitoring import optimize_monitoring_system

# Apply optimizations
await optimize_monitoring_system('optimized')
```

## üìä Monitoring Performance

### Check Current Status
```python
from app.monitoring import MonitoringOptimizationManager

manager = MonitoringOptimizationManager()
status = manager.get_optimization_status()
print(f"Optimization Level: {status['current_performance_level']}")
```

### Get Recommendations
```python
recommendations = manager.get_performance_recommendations()
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"‚Ä¢ {rec}")
```

### Monitor System Performance
```bash
# Run the performance monitor
python monitor_performance.py
```

## üîÑ Reverting Optimizations

To return to normal performance:

```python
from app.monitoring import MonitoringOptimizationManager

manager = MonitoringOptimizationManager()
await manager.reset_optimizations()
```

Or run:
```bash
python apply_monitoring_optimizations.py
# Select 'normal' when prompted
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Development
- Use normal optimization level
- Enable debug metrics
- Shorter intervals for testing

### For Production
- Use optimized level by default
- Enable performance profiling
- Longer intervals for stability
- Monitor resource usage regularly

### For High-Load Systems
- Use emergency level if needed
- Disable non-critical monitoring
- Implement external monitoring
- Scale monitoring infrastructure

## üöÄ Advanced Optimization

### Custom Optimization Rules
```python
from app.monitoring.performance_optimizer import get_optimized_interval

# Get optimized interval for your task
optimized_interval = get_optimized_interval(
    base_interval=30.0,
    task_type='quality_checks'
)
```

### Task Skipping for Performance
```python
from app.monitoring.performance_optimizer import should_skip_task

# Skip non-critical tasks under high load
if not should_skip_task('analytics', skip_probability=0.2):
    await run_analytics_task()
```

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Still High CPU Usage?
1. Check if all monitoring services are using optimized intervals
2. Restart the monitoring system
3. Consider disabling non-essential components
4. Increase system resources

### Memory Issues?
1. Reduce data retention periods further
2. Enable aggressive cleanup
3. Limit in-memory data structures
4. Use external storage for historical data

### Monitoring Not Working?
1. Check if emergency mode disabled critical features
2. Verify component configurations
3. Reset to normal optimization level
4. Check service logs for errors

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience performance issues:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for optimization manager logs
2. **System Resources**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
3. **Component Status**: Verify all monitoring components are healthy
4. **Configuration**: Review optimization settings
5. **Scaling**: Consider horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios

## üîÑ Automatic Optimization

The system includes automatic optimization that:
- Monitors system performance every minute
- Adjusts optimization levels automatically
- Provides performance recommendations
- Logs all optimization changes
- Maintains performance history

This ensures your monitoring system adapts to changing resource conditions automatically.

**Note**: These optimizations maintain essential monitoring functionality while reducing resource usage. Critical alerts and core monitoring features remain active even under emergency optimization.
