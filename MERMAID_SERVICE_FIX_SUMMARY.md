# Mermaid Service Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was showing "Mermaid service not available. Please check service configuration." error even though streamlit-mermaid was installed.

## Root Cause
The code was still using the service registry pattern `optional_service('mermaid_service', ...)` instead of directly importing the `streamlit_mermaid` package. This was a regression from a previous partial fix.

## Files Fixed

### 1. streamlit_app.py
- **Added**: Direct import of `streamlit_mermaid as stmd` with availability check
- **Replaced**: `optional_service('mermaid_service', ...)` calls with direct `stmd.st_mermaid()` calls
- **Improved**: Error messages to be more informative about package requirements

### 2. app/ui/analysis_display.py  
- **Added**: Direct import of `streamlit_mermaid as stmd` with availability check
- **Replaced**: `optional_service('mermaid_service', ...)` call with direct `stmd.st_mermaid()` call

### 3. app/ui/mermaid_diagrams.py
- **Added**: Direct import of `streamlit_mermaid as stmd` with availability check  
- **Replaced**: `optional_service('mermaid_service', ...)` call with direct `stmd.st_mermaid()` call
- **Cleaned**: Removed orphaned error handling line

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```python
mermaid_service = optional_service('mermaid_service', context='...')
if mermaid_service:
    mermaid_service.render(mermaid_code, height=height)
else:
    st.error("Mermaid service not available. Please check service configuration.")
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
try:
    import streamlit_mermaid as stmd
    MERMAID_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    MERMAID_AVAILABLE = False
    stmd = None

# Later in code:
if MERMAID_AVAILABLE and stmd:
    stmd.st_mermaid(mermaid_code, height=height)
else:
    st.info("ðŸ’¡ Mermaid diagrams require the streamlit-mermaid package. Showing code instead:")
    st.code(mermaid_code, language="mermaid")
```

## Verification
- âœ… `streamlit_mermaid` package is installed (version 0.3.0)
- âœ… All imports work correctly without errors
- âœ… Test script `test_streamlit_mermaid_fix.py` passes all tests
- âœ… Streamlit app imports successfully
- âœ… All UI modules import without errors

## Impact
- Mermaid diagrams should now render properly in all parts of the application
- No more "Mermaid service not available" error messages
- Better user experience with informative messages when package is missing
- All diagram types (Context, Container, Sequence, Infrastructure, etc.) should display correctly

## Testing
Run `python3 test_streamlit_mermaid_fix.py` to verify the fix is working correctly.
