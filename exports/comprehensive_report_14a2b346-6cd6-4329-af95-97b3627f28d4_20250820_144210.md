### Original Description

> Autonomous Incident Triage & Remediation (Agentic) - Summary Build an autonomous agent that detects anomalies across production signals, triages likely root causes, drafts a remediation plan, and‚Äîafter human approval‚Äîexecutes runbook steps. All actions are auditable and policy-guarded.
 Problem / Opportunity Today, engineers are paged for noisy alerts and spend valuable time correlating logs/metrics/traces and running routine fix scripts. We need a closed-loop, human-in-the-loop system to reduce MTTD/MTTR and cut alert fatigue while keeping strict safety controls.
 Goals (What this epic will achieve)
 ‚Ä¢ Cut MTTR by ‚â•30% and reduce false-positive pages by ‚â•25%.
‚Ä¢ Autonomously correlate metrics/logs/traces around change events to propose the most likely cause.
‚Ä¢ Produce a clear, reviewable action plan with risk/rollback and evidence.
‚Ä¢ Execute approved playbooks via a controlled runner with full audit trail.
‚Ä¢ Create/update Jira incidents automatically and post progress to Slack/Teams.
 Non-Goals (Out of scope for this epic)
 ‚Ä¢ Building bespoke deep ML models beyond seasonal baselines/change-point detection.
‚Ä¢ Broad auto-execute in production without guardrails (limited, policy-gated auto-execute only).
‚Ä¢ Replacing existing observability platforms.
 Success Metrics / KPIs
 ‚Ä¢ Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) ‚Üì 30%
‚Ä¢ Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) ‚Üì 30%
‚Ä¢ False-positive rate ‚Üì 25%
‚Ä¢ Auto-resolved (approved+executed) incidents ‚â• 20% of P2+ tickets
‚Ä¢ Median ‚Äúplan approval‚Äù time ‚â§ 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ 100% of actions audit-logged (actor, time, evidence, script hash, outcome)
 High-Level Solution
 ‚Ä¢ Observability adapters: Datadog/Prometheus (metrics), ELK/Loki/CloudWatch (logs), Jaeger/Tempo/APM (traces), Sentry (errors), K8s/Cloud APIs (infra), CI/CD (change events).
‚Ä¢ Detection engine: rules (thresholds, burn-rate, p95 latency) + statistical baselines (seasonality/change-point).
‚Ä¢ RCA correlator: align spikes with recent deploys/config flips; map blast radius using service graph (OpenTelemetry/CMDB).
‚Ä¢ Planner: compile a remediation plan (steps, scope, risk, rollback) with confidence and evidence.
‚Ä¢ Approval gate: Slack/Teams message with Approve/Reject buttons; OPA policies enforce who/what/where.
‚Ä¢ Executor: controlled runner executes scripts/playbooks with dry-run; short-lived tokens; secrets from Vault/SM.
‚Ä¢ Audit & reporting: structured logs with PII redaction; Jira updates; post-mortem summary artifact.
 Scope (Phased) Phase 1 (Detect + Plan + Approve): adapters, detection, correlation, Slack approval, Jira integration, audit trail. Phase 2 (Execute + Guardrails): controlled runner, rollback automation, limited pre-approved playbooks for P2/P3. Phase 3 (Refine + Auto-Execute): expand auto-execute for low-risk, improve ranking, add service dependency graph.
 User Stories (with Acceptance Criteria)
 1. As an on-call SRE, I receive a Slack message with a proposed remediation plan including evidence and a confidence score. Given an eligible anomaly is detected, When the agent drafts a plan, Then a Slack/Teams card shows: summary, suspected cause, affected services, risk, rollback, and Approve/Reject buttons.
1. As an incident commander, I want all agent actions mirrored in a Jira incident. Given a plan is created, Then a Jira ticket is created/updated with context (timeline, evidence links, plan, approvals, outcomes).
1. As a platform admin, I want guardrails on execution. Given OPA policies are configured, When a plan targets a restricted env/script, Then the agent blocks auto-execute and requires correct approvals or denies execution.
1. As a security/compliance lead, I need a full audit trail. Given any approval or execution occurs, Then the system records who/when/what (script hash, parameters, env, result) and stores redacted logs.
1. As a developer, I want low-risk fixes to run quickly once approved. Given an approved plan for a known playbook, When executed by the runner, Then the outcome is posted back to Slack and Jira with logs and rollback status.
 Definition of Done (Epic-level)
 ‚Ä¢ End-to-end flow demonstrated in staging: detect ‚Üí correlate ‚Üí plan ‚Üí approve ‚Üí execute ‚Üí audit ‚Üí Jira update.
‚Ä¢ Policies enforced (OPA): environments, scripts, roles; unit/integration tests cover allow/deny paths.
‚Ä¢ Secrets not logged; API keys never persisted; PII redaction validated in logs.
‚Ä¢ Dashboards for KPIs (MTTD/MTTR, auto-resolve rate) published.
‚Ä¢ Runbooks/playbooks documented; on-call handbook updated.
 Functional Requirements
 ‚Ä¢ Read-only adapters for metrics/logs/traces and change events.
‚Ä¢ Detection supports rules and statistical baselines; tunable thresholds per service.
‚Ä¢ Correlation aligns signals within a time window; ranks suspects by correlation and recency of change.
‚Ä¢ Planner outputs: steps, scope, risk, rollback, confidence, evidence links.
‚Ä¢ Slack/Teams interactive approval; timeout/escalation to next on-call.
‚Ä¢ Executor runs in isolated worker with dry-run; short-lived tokens; idempotent scripts.
‚Ä¢ Jira integration for incident lifecycle.
 Non-Functional Requirements
 ‚Ä¢ Reliability: 99.5% availability for the agent control plane.
‚Ä¢ Latency: first plan within 90s of eligible alert.
‚Ä¢ Security: least-privilege IAM; all secrets in Vault/Secrets Manager; no secrets in logs.
‚Ä¢ Observability: structured logs with session_id/phase/provider; traces around each action.
‚Ä¢ Audit retention: ‚â• 12 months.
 Dependencies
 ‚Ä¢ Access to observability platforms and CI/CD change events.
‚Ä¢ Slack/Teams app with interactive actions.
‚Ä¢ Vault/Secrets Manager; OPA policy service; Jira project/permissions.
‚Ä¢ Service graph/CMDB (optional, improves RCA).
 Risks & Mitigations
 ‚Ä¢ False positives ‚Üí require confidence threshold + human approval; tune rules/baselines.
‚Ä¢ Over-permissioned execution ‚Üí least privilege, short-lived tokens, OPA guardrails.
‚Ä¢ Noisy alerts ‚Üí implement deduplication, correlation windows, cooldowns.
‚Ä¢ Script risk ‚Üí mandatory rollback steps, dry-run mode, canary/limited blast radius.
 Rollout Plan
 ‚Ä¢ Staging pilot on 2‚Äì3 services with runbooks.
‚Ä¢ Game-day to validate detection/correlation and rollback.
‚Ä¢ Gradual prod rollout: P3/P2 with approval, then limited pre-approved P2 where safe.
‚Ä¢ Post-deployment review after 2 weeks; adjust thresholds/policies.
 Data & Access Controls
 ‚Ä¢ Read-only service accounts to observability sources.
‚Ä¢ IP allow-listing where supported.
‚Ä¢ All queries and actions tagged with session_id and actor; PII redaction in logs.

- **Slack API**: Technology component for system implementation
- **Jira API**: Technology component for system implementation

#### üèóÔ∏è How It All Works Together

The solution for the Autonomous Incident Triage & Remediation system relies on a carefully integrated technology stack that addresses both the technical and functional requirements of the use case, providing a seamless and efficient workflow. At the core is FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs, which serves as the backbone for our custom application logic, interfacing with other services and delivering real-time detection, planning, and execution capabilities. This application ingests metrics from Prometheus and logs from ElasticSearch to detect anomalies through defined rules and statistical baselines. OpenTelemetry is employed for capturing distributed traces, helping to correlate incidents with recent deployments or configuration changes, thus supporting in-depth Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

For execution and policy management, the stack is hosted on Kubernetes, providing scalability and robust orchestration of our microservices architecture, ensuring high availability (99.5% as required). Kubernetes is equipped with Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce guardrails and security policies across execution environments, while HashiCorp Vault manages secrets and sensitive information, ensuring that any data needed for execution is accessed securely and just-in-time. Human-in-the-loop interaction is facilitated by our integration with the Slack API, through which real-time notifications and interactive approval workflows are managed, providing a user-friendly interface for engineers to approve remediations directly within their communication tool. Once approved, the remediation steps are executed, and all actions are audit-logged to ensure compliance and traceability, fulfilling the security and auditing requirements.

In terms of integration, our system uses the Jira API to manage the incident lifecycle, automatically creating and updating incidents with evidence, action plans, and outcomes, thus enhancing traceability and record-keeping. This collective use of technology enables an end-to-end solution by ensuring tight integration of application monitoring (Prometheus, ElasticSearch, OpenTelemetry), secure execution (Kubernetes, Vault, OPA), and seamless user-interaction (FastAPI, Slack API, Jira API). Each of these components is meticulously chosen to tackle a specific aspect of the problem space, ultimately reducing MTTR, minimizing false alerts, and ensuring safety and compliance through auditable and policy-controlled actions.

## 6. ‚ùì Questions & Answers

### Question & Answer History

#### Round 1 - 2025-08-20 14:37:00 UTC

**Responses Provided:**

**Process Scope:**
> Yes. All steps‚Äîsignal ingestion, correlation, plan generation, approval, and execution‚Äîare performed via APIs/CLIs or orchestration runners. The agent will only execute pre-registered runbooks/playbooks that expose programmatic interfaces (e.g., Kubernetes API, cloud provider APIs, CI/CD rollback endpoints, feature-flag APIs). Any step that cannot be automated must be represented as a checklist task for a human; the agent will not attempt non-API actions. Guardrails (OPA policies, short-lived credentials, dry-run) are mandatory.

**Data Sources:**
> Metrics: Prometheus (HTTP API), Datadog/New Relic/Dynatrace (REST APIs). Near-real-time (typically 10‚Äì60s freshness).
Logs: ELK/OpenSearch (REST), Grafana Loki (HTTP), CloudWatch/GCP/Azure logs (SDK/REST). Near-real-time (<5‚Äì15s typical).
Traces: Jaeger/Tempo (HTTP/gRPC), vendor APMs, OpenTelemetry Collector (OTLP). Near-real-time stream.
Change events: GitHub/GitLab/Argo CD/Spinnaker (webhooks + REST), Kubernetes events (watch API), cloud audit logs (CloudTrail/GCP/Azure), feature flags (LaunchDarkly/ConfigCat APIs). Real-time via webhooks; otherwise polled at short intervals.
Access is via least-privilege, read-only service accounts/roles per environment; tokens/keys are stored in Vault/Secrets Manager and injected at runtime; all queries are audit-logged with session_id and scope.

**Decision Complexity:**
> The agent blends rules and baselines to rank hypotheses, then composes a plan using known playbooks (steps, scope, risk, rollback, confidence). Oversight is policy-driven:
Low risk (e.g., restart pod, scale deployment, cache flush): 1-click human approval, optionally pre-approved for P3/P2 within a limited blast radius.
Medium risk (e.g., rollback last deploy, toggle feature flag): explicit approval required; 1‚Äì2 approvers based on environment.
High risk (e.g., schema change, data deletion): never auto-execute; must be handed off to human ownership.
If confidence falls below a threshold or evidence conflicts, the agent requests guidance or opens an investigation ticket rather than proposing execution.

**Integrations:**
> Systems/APIs: observability (metrics/logs/traces), CI/CD and deploy tools, Kubernetes/cloud provider APIs, secret stores (Vault/SM), chat (Slack/Teams), ticketing (Jira), policy engine (OPA).
AuthN/Z: OAuth2/OIDC or workload identity where possible; otherwise scoped API tokens. All secrets pulled just-in-time from Vault/SM; never persisted or logged; PII redaction enabled.
Permissions: least-privilege roles; read-only for data sources; tightly scoped execution roles for the runner; short-lived credentials for approved actions.
Error handling: timeouts and idempotent requests; retries with exponential backoff and jitter; circuit breakers; rate-limit awareness (429/5xx handling); pagination and partial-result tolerance; signed webhook verification and event deduplication; full structured audit logs (who/when/what, script hash, parameters, outcome).
