## 1. üìù Original Requirements

### Original Description

> As a support lead
I want the agent to prioritise tickets using urgency, regulatory impact, and customer profile
So that critical issues are handled first
Business value: SLA adherence; reduces regulatory exposure.
Assumptions: Access to ticketing system; policy weights configured.
Acceptance criteria:
Given an incoming ticket
When the agent scores it
Then it assigns a priority (P1‚ÄìP4) with an explanation and the governing policy reference
Given a backlog
When priorities change (e.g., vulnerable customer flag)
Then the agent reorders the queue and notifies owners
Non-functional / Controls:
Deterministic tie-break rules; drift monitoring on scoring model; audit of re-prioritisations.

**Confidence:** 100.0% `‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà`

#### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Technology Stack

**Programming Languages:**
- **Python**: High-level programming language ideal for automation, data processing, and AI applications

**Web Frameworks & APIs:**
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints

**Databases & Storage:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source relational database with strong ACID compliance and extensibility

**Cloud & Infrastructure:**
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events

**Communication & Integration:**
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker software that implements Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

**Monitoring & Operations:**
- **Prometheus**: Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit

**Other Technologies:**
- **LangChain**: Technology component for system implementation
- **Slack API**: Technology component for system implementation
- **Jira API**: Technology component for system implementation
- **Grafana Loki**: Technology component for system implementation

#### üèóÔ∏è How It All Works Together

In this setup, the system architecture is designed around a serverless microservices approach, leveraging AWS Lambda as the runtime environment to handle scaling requirements and execute the business logic of ticket prioritization automatically. When a ticket is created or updated, a trigger initiates a Lambda function, which utilizes Python and the FastAPI framework to serve as a lightweight, high-speed service for processing incoming ticket data. This service accesses a PostgreSQL database, storing policy weights and historical ticket data to ensure that the scoring and prioritization are executed rapidly and updated in real-time.

The heart of the ticket prioritization system is the LangChain integration, which processes natural language policy guidelines to understand urgency or impact intuitively, aiding in scoring automation based on the set criteria. The ticket's priority, once calculated, is updated in the Jira system using its API, maintaining smooth and real-time ticket status management. For in-tool updates, RabbitMQ processes and queues ticket data and priority changes, ensuring transactional consistency and enabling retries with exponential backoff and dead-letter queue management.

For notifications and communications, the Slack API is used to inform ticket owners and support teams through ChatOps alerts of priority updates. Hourly summaries generated from the system backlog are also communicated using these channels to prevent notification fatigue. Monitoring and logging tasks are managed by Prometheus and Grafana Loki, which track changes, perform drift monitoring on the scoring model, and log audit trails in real-time. This specific technology stack is well-suited to the requirements due to its modular, scalable nature, where each component effectively facilitates various aspects of ticket prioritization, real-time database operations, secure communications, and robust live monitoring. This integration ensures that SLA adherence and regulatory exposure are mitigated effectively within the constraints provided.

#### üí≠ Reasoning & Analysis

Multi-agent system using coordinator_based architecture with 4 specialized agents: RegulatoryAssessmentAgent, CustomerProfilingAgent, PriorityScoringAgent. Achieves 98% system autonomy through collaborative reasoning and distributed decision-making. Deploy coordinator as highly available service, then worker agents. Use load balancing for coordination requests.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Considerations

- Full automation implementation recommended
- Consider phased rollout to minimize risk
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation
- Complex technology stack - ensure adequate technical expertise

### Question & Answer History

#### Round 1 - 2025-08-28 11:51:51 UTC

**Responses Provided:**

**Integrations:**
> In-tool updates:
Update priority + add a system comment explaining score, contributing factors, and policy reference used.
Optional: set a rank/order field for queue ordering.
Notifications:
Native ticketing notifications (email/push) triggered by priority change.
ChatOps: Slack/Teams webhook to owner/on-call channel (includes deep link to ticket).
Digest: Hourly summary for bulk reorders to avoid alert fatigue.
Reliability & errors:
Transactional updates with optimistic locking (fail if updated_at changed ‚Üí retry).
Retries with exponential backoff; circuit breaker on repeated failures.
Dead-letter queue for failed notifications ‚Üí visible on Ops dashboard.
Audit trail: correlation ID across scoring ‚Üí ticket update ‚Üí notification; store old vs new priority, score breakdown, and rules version.
Reversal/safety: If a later signal downgrades urgency (e.g., false vulnerable flag), agent re-scores, updates priority, and posts rationale; all changes are reversible and logged.

**Data Sources:**
> Urgency:
Source: Ticket fields (impact, urgency, affected_users, service); SLO/SLA config in ticketing tool.
Perms: Read ticket fields & SLA objects.
Regulatory impact:
Source: Policy rules engine/KB (internal service or config repo) that maps product/service + incident type ‚Üí regulatory weight (e.g., FCA, PCI events > normal).
Perms: Read-only to rules endpoint; no PII required.
Customer profile:
Source: CRM/CDP (Salesforce/Dynamics) for customer tier, vulnerability flag, open complaints, arrears.
Perms: Read-only on CRM profiles (RBAC; field-level security); data minimisation to only the attributes used in scoring.
Join keys: Ticket customer_id or account_id ‚Üí CRM record; service/component key ‚Üí policy rules.

**Decision Complexity:**
> Configuration store: Versioned YAML/JSON in a Policy Config Service (backed by Git or a config DB).
Structure:
version: 2025-08-01
weights:
  urgency.immediate: 5
  urgency.high: 3
  regulatory.pci_breach: 5
  regulatory.vulnerable_customer: 4
  customer.tier_premier: 2
  customer.vulnerability_flag: 4
tie_breakers: ["regulatory", "urgency", "customer_tier", "created_at"]
thresholds:
  P1: "score >= 9"
  P2: "score >= 6"
  P3: "score >= 3"
  P4: "else"
Change management: 4-eyes approval via PR; schema validation + unit tests on rules; canary rollout via feature flag; runtime hot-reload; all changes audited (who/when/why).
Drift monitoring: Nightly backtest of last N days‚Äô tickets vs. SLAs; alert on precision/recall deltas.
