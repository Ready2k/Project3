# Draw.io Export Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was showing "‚ùå Draw.io export not available. Service not registered." error when users tried to export diagrams to Draw.io format.

## Root Cause
The application was trying to use a `drawio_exporter` service that was never implemented or registered in the service registry. The code was expecting a service that didn't exist.

## Solution
Replaced the service-dependent export functionality with direct export capabilities that provide useful alternatives for users.

### Files Modified

**streamlit_app.py** - Fixed 2 functions:

1. **`export_to_drawio()`**
   - **Before**: Tried to use `optional_service('drawio_exporter', ...)`
   - **After**: Provides direct Mermaid file download and Draw.io XML wrapper

2. **`export_infrastructure_to_drawio()`**
   - **Before**: Tried to use `optional_service('drawio_exporter', ...)`
   - **After**: Provides JSON specification download and Draw.io XML wrapper

## New Functionality

### For Mermaid Diagrams:
- ‚úÖ **Mermaid File Download** (.mmd) - Direct import into Draw.io
- ‚úÖ **Draw.io XML File** (.drawio) - Contains Mermaid code as reference
- ‚úÖ **Clear Instructions** - Step-by-step guide for Draw.io import
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Import Options** - Both direct Mermaid import and XML file

### For Infrastructure Diagrams:
- ‚úÖ **JSON Specification** - Complete infrastructure spec for reference
- ‚úÖ **Draw.io XML File** - Contains JSON spec as text reference
- ‚úÖ **Usage Instructions** - Guide for using cloud provider libraries
- ‚úÖ **Alternative Tool Support** - JSON works with Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ‚ùå "Service not registered" error
- ‚ùå No export functionality
- ‚ùå Dead-end user experience

### After:
- ‚úÖ Immediate download options
- ‚úÖ Clear instructions for Draw.io usage
- ‚úÖ Multiple export formats

- ‚úÖ Support for both Mermaid and infrastructure diagrams

## Technical Details

### Mermaid Export Process:
1. User clicks "üìê Export Draw.io" button
2. App generates .mmd file with raw Mermaid code
3. App creates .drawio XML wrapper with Mermaid code as text
4. User gets both files with instructions

### Infrastructure Export Process:
1. User clicks "üìê Export Draw.io" button
2. App generates JSON specification file
3. App creates .drawio XML wrapper with JSON as text
4. User gets both files with cloud provider guidance

### Draw.io Integration:
- **Option 1**: Import .mmd file directly using Draw.io's Mermaid feature
- **Option 2**: Use .drawio file as reference while manually creating diagram
