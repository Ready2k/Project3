# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Meet Your Agent Team" section in the Streamlit application is displaying duplicate agents instead of unique agents. When the system generates 5 agents, it shows 5 identical "User Management Agent" entries instead of 5 distinct agents with different names and roles. This bug is caused by a duplicate line in the agent role extraction code that adds the same agent roles multiple times to the display list.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the agentic AI recommendations, I want to see distinct, unique agents in the "Meet Your Agent Team" section, so that I can understand the different roles and responsibilities of each agent in my multi-agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays the "Meet Your Agent Team" section THEN each agent SHALL have a unique name and role
2. WHEN multiple agents are generated THEN the system SHALL display different agent names based on their specific responsibilities
3. WHEN 5 agents are created THEN the system SHALL show 5 distinct agents with different names like "User Management Agent", "Data Processing Agent", "Communication Agent", etc.
4. WHEN agent roles are extracted from recommendations THEN the system SHALL NOT duplicate the same agent multiple times

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the agent display system, I want the agent role extraction code to be clean and efficient, so that there are no duplicate operations or redundant data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting agent roles from recommendations THEN the system SHALL only process each agent role once
2. WHEN building the agent_roles_found list THEN the system SHALL NOT have duplicate lines of code that add the same data multiple times
3. WHEN the code executes THEN there SHALL be no redundant operations that cause performance issues or data duplication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different types of requirements, I want the multi-agent system to generate appropriately diverse agents, so that each agent has a meaningful and distinct role in handling my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the multi-agent designer creates agent roles THEN each agent SHALL have a unique name based on the requirement content
2. WHEN agent names are generated THEN the system SHALL use the _generate_agent_name method to create contextually appropriate names
3. WHEN displaying agent teams THEN the system SHALL show the actual diversity of agents created by the multi-agent designer
4. WHEN agent roles are identical THEN the system SHALL still display them with appropriate differentiation or consolidation
