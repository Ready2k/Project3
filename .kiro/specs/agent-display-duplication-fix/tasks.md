# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix duplicate code execution in agent role extraction
  - Remove the duplicate line in streamlit_app.py that processes agent_roles twice
  - Add validation to ensure agent_roles_data is processed only once
  - Test that agent_roles_found list contains unique entries
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance multi-agent system designer for better agent diversity
  - [x] 2.1 Improve agent role generation in MultiAgentSystemDesigner
    - Modify `_define_agent_roles` method to ensure unique agent names and responsibilities
    - Add validation to prevent identical agents from being generated
    - Implement fallback logic for diverse agent creation when LLM fails
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 2.2 Enhance agent name generation logic
    - Improve the `_generate_agent_name` method to create more diverse names
    - Add logic to differentiate agents when multiple agents have similar domains
    - Implement sequential numbering or role-based differentiation for similar agents
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Add agent deduplication and validation logic
  - [x] 3.1 Implement agent deduplication in display logic
    - Add validation to detect duplicate agents by name and responsibility
    - Implement logic to merge or differentiate duplicate agents
    - Add error handling for edge cases in agent display
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.3_

  - [x] 3.2 Enhance agent display validation
    - Add checks to ensure each displayed agent has unique identification
    - Implement validation for agent data completeness and accuracy
    - Add logging for agent display issues and debugging information
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Create comprehensive test suite for agent display functionality
  - [x] 4.1 Write unit tests for agent extraction and display
    - Test agent role extraction without duplicate processing
    - Test agent name generation with various requirement types
    - Test deduplication logic with duplicate agent scenarios
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.3_

  - [x] 4.2 Create integration tests for multi-agent workflows
    - Test end-to-end agent generation and display flow
    - Test multi-agent designer with different requirement types
    - Test agent team display with various agent configurations
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Validate fix with original bug reproduction
  - [x] 5.1 Reproduce the original 5 identical agents bug
    - Create test case that reproduces the exact issue from the user report
    - Document the bug reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior
    - Verify that the bug is consistently reproducible before applying fixes
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

  - [x] 5.2 Verify complete fix implementation
    - Apply all fixes and test with the original bug reproduction case
    - Verify that 5 unique agents are displayed instead of 5 identical ones
    - Test with multiple different requirement types to ensure robustness
    - Document the successful fix and improved behavior
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_
