# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current diagram generation system is not utilizing the enhanced tech stack and architecture explanation ("How It All Works Together" narrative) that are generated during the analysis phase. This results in diagrams that may not accurately reflect the recommended technology stack and architectural insights that users see in the analysis section.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated diagrams to use the same recommended tech stack that appears in my analysis results, so that the diagrams accurately reflect the technologies I've been recommended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates any diagram THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced tech stack from the analysis phase
2. WHEN the enhanced tech stack is available THEN the system SHALL pass it to the diagram generation functions
3. WHEN the enhanced tech stack is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to the original recommendation tech stack
4. WHEN generating a Tech Stack Wiring Diagram THEN the system SHALL use the exact technologies from the enhanced tech stack

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated diagrams to incorporate the architectural insights from the "How It All Works Together" section, so that the diagrams reflect the same understanding of how components interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates any diagram THEN the system SHALL include the architecture explanation as context for the LLM
2. WHEN the architecture explanation is available THEN the system SHALL pass it to the diagram generation prompt
3. WHEN generating diagrams THEN the LLM SHALL use the architecture explanation to understand component relationships
4. WHEN the architecture explanation is not available THEN the system SHALL generate diagrams based on the requirement and tech stack only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the diagram generation functions to receive all available analysis data, so that diagrams are consistent with the analysis results shown to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling diagram generation functions THEN the system SHALL pass enhanced tech stack if available
2. WHEN calling diagram generation functions THEN the system SHALL pass architecture explanation if available
3. WHEN diagram generation functions receive enhanced data THEN they SHALL prioritize it over basic recommendation data
4. WHEN enhanced data is not available THEN the functions SHALL fall back to existing behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent technology recommendations across analysis and diagrams, so that I don't see conflicting information in different parts of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analysis results and diagrams THEN the technology stack SHALL be consistent between both views
2. WHEN the analysis shows specific technologies THEN the diagrams SHALL use those same technologies
3. WHEN generating multiple diagrams THEN they SHALL all use the same enhanced tech stack
4. WHEN the enhanced tech stack changes THEN subsequent diagrams SHALL use the updated stack
