# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds proper C4 diagram support to the Automated AI Assessment (AAA) system's diagram generation capabilities. The system currently has Context and Container diagrams, but they use standard Mermaid flowchart syntax instead of the proper C4 diagram syntax as specified in the Mermaid C4 documentation (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/c4.html) and C4-PlantUML specification (https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/blob/master/README.md).

The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to software architecture diagrams with four levels: Context, Container, Component, and Code. This feature will implement proper C4 syntax support and add it as a new option in the system diagrams menu alongside the existing diagram types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to generate proper C4 diagrams using Mermaid's C4 syntax, so that I can create standardized architecture documentation that follows C4 modeling conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "C4 Diagram" from the diagram type dropdown THEN the system SHALL display it as a new option alongside existing diagram types
2. WHEN I generate a C4 diagram THEN the system SHALL use proper Mermaid C4 syntax (C4Context, C4Container, etc.) instead of flowchart syntax
3. WHEN the C4 diagram is generated THEN it SHALL follow the C4 model hierarchy and conventions for showing system boundaries, relationships, and components
4. WHEN I view the generated C4 diagram THEN it SHALL render correctly in the Streamlit interface using the streamlit-mermaid component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the system, I want the C4 diagram generation to integrate seamlessly with the existing diagram infrastructure, so that it works consistently with other diagram types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate a C4 diagram THEN the system SHALL use the same LLM provider configuration as other diagram types
2. WHEN C4 diagram generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback content similar to other diagram types
3. WHEN I generate a C4 diagram THEN it SHALL be stored in session state using the same pattern as other diagram types
4. WHEN the system validates C4 diagram syntax THEN it SHALL recognize C4Context, C4Container, and other C4-specific syntax as valid

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want clear documentation and descriptions for the C4 diagram option, so that I understand when and why to use it compared to other diagram types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over or select the C4 diagram option THEN the system SHALL display a clear description explaining what C4 diagrams show
2. WHEN I view the diagram type descriptions THEN the C4 diagram description SHALL clearly differentiate it from Context and Container diagrams
3. WHEN I generate a C4 diagram THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user feedback during generation
4. WHEN C4 diagram generation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages specific to C4 syntax issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the C4 diagram implementation to follow the existing code patterns and architecture, so that it's maintainable and consistent with the rest of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing C4 diagram support THEN the code SHALL follow the same async function pattern as other diagram builders (build_context_diagram, build_sequence_diagram, etc.)
2. WHEN adding C4 diagram validation THEN it SHALL extend the existing Mermaid validation functions to recognize C4 syntax
3. WHEN implementing C4 diagram generation THEN it SHALL use the same LLM prompt structure and error handling patterns as existing diagram types
4. WHEN adding the C4 option to the UI THEN it SHALL integrate into the existing selectbox and conditional logic without disrupting other diagram types
