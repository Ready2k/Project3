## Validation Criteria

Each task must meet the following criteria before being marked complete:

1. **Functionality Preservation**: All existing features must work exactly as before
2. **Test Coverage**: All code changes must be covered by appropriate tests
3. **Performance**: No degradation in performance, with improvements where specified
4. **Documentation**: All new code must be properly documented
5. **Code Quality**: All code must pass linting, type checking, and quality gates
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must not break existing integrations or workflows

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase can be deployed independently
2. **Feature Flags**: Ability to switch between old and new implementations
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite validation before each deployment
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Quick rollback capability for each phase
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of system health during migration
