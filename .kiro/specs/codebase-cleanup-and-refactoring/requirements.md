# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive cleanup and refactoring of the AAA (Automated AI Assessment) codebase based on a thorough code review. The system has grown organically and accumulated technical debt that impacts maintainability, performance, and developer experience. This effort will modernize the codebase architecture, eliminate redundancies, and establish consistent patterns throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consolidate Entry Points

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, clear entry point for the Streamlit application so that I can easily understand and maintain the UI codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL use only one primary Streamlit entry point
2. WHEN developers look for the main UI file THEN they SHALL find it clearly identified as the primary entry point
3. WHEN the refactored entry point is used THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. WHEN legacy entry points exist THEN they SHALL be moved to a legacy directory with clear deprecation notices
5. WHEN the consolidation is complete THEN all references SHALL point to the new primary entry point

### Requirement 2: Break Down Monolithic Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the large monolithic files broken down into focused, maintainable modules so that I can work on specific features without navigating through thousands of lines of code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file exceeds 1000 lines THEN it SHALL be evaluated for decomposition into smaller modules
2. WHEN `streamlit_app.py` is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into focused UI components with single responsibilities
3. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL have a clear, single purpose and well-defined interface
4. WHEN the decomposition is complete THEN the total lines of code per file SHALL not exceed 500 lines
5. WHEN modules are imported THEN they SHALL follow consistent import patterns throughout the codebase

### Requirement 3: Standardize File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all files organized in their proper locations according to established conventions so that I can quickly find and work with relevant code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files exist in the root directory THEN they SHALL be moved to the appropriate test directories
2. WHEN configuration files exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a single configuration hierarchy
3. WHEN documentation files exist THEN outdated summaries SHALL be removed and current docs SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN utility files exist THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate utility directories
5. WHEN the organization is complete THEN the directory structure SHALL follow established Python project conventions

### Requirement 4: Remove Unused and Duplicate Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused and duplicate files removed from the codebase so that I can focus on active, relevant code without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate files are identified THEN the obsolete versions SHALL be removed or archived
2. WHEN debug files exist in production THEN they SHALL be removed or moved to development-only locations
3. WHEN suspicious files like `nonexistent.json` exist THEN they SHALL be properly renamed or removed
4. WHEN outdated summary files exist THEN only current documentation SHALL be retained
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN no unused imports or dead code SHALL remain

### Requirement 5: Fix Import and Dependency Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent, clean import patterns throughout the codebase so that dependencies are clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are used THEN they SHALL follow a consistent pattern (standard library, third-party, local)
2. WHEN fallback imports exist THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper dependency injection or configuration
3. WHEN circular imports are detected THEN they SHALL be resolved through architectural improvements
4. WHEN missing imports are found THEN they SHALL be added or the references SHALL be removed
5. WHEN the import cleanup is complete THEN all modules SHALL import successfully without errors

### Requirement 6: Standardize Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns throughout the application so that I can predict and maintain error behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions can fail THEN they SHALL use consistent error handling patterns (exceptions or Result types)
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged using the standard logging system
3. WHEN print statements exist for debugging THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper logging
4. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL be user-friendly and actionable
5. WHEN the standardization is complete THEN error handling SHALL be predictable across all modules

### Requirement 7: Improve Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, hierarchical configuration system so that I can easily manage settings across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple configuration files exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a single hierarchy
2. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN they SHALL override base configuration appropriately
3. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN it SHALL use a consistent configuration service
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN they SHALL not require code changes in multiple locations
5. WHEN the configuration system is complete THEN it SHALL support development, staging, and production environments

### Requirement 8: Enhance Test Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests properly organized and functional so that I can confidently make changes and verify system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files exist THEN they SHALL be in the appropriate test directories (unit, integration, e2e)
2. WHEN test imports are used THEN they SHALL reference existing, functional modules
3. WHEN test references are made THEN they SHALL point to actual test files, not placeholders
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute successfully without import errors
5. WHEN the test organization is complete THEN the test suite SHALL provide comprehensive coverage

### Requirement 9: Optimize Performance and Startup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to start quickly and perform efficiently so that I can be productive without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load in under 10 seconds
2. WHEN heavy components are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded lazily to improve startup time
3. WHEN modules are imported THEN only necessary dependencies SHALL be loaded initially
4. WHEN caching is used THEN it SHALL be consistent and effective across the application
5. WHEN the optimization is complete THEN startup time SHALL be improved by at least 30%

### Requirement 10: Establish Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code quality standards enforced throughout the codebase so that all code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include appropriate type hints
2. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL have clear docstrings following established patterns
3. WHEN logging is used THEN it SHALL use the structured logging system consistently
4. WHEN code complexity is high THEN it SHALL be refactored into smaller, focused functions
5. WHEN the standards are established THEN they SHALL be enforced through automated tooling

### Requirement 11: Improve Documentation and Comments

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation exists THEN it SHALL be current and accurate
2. WHEN multiple summary files exist THEN only the most current SHALL be retained
3. WHEN code comments exist THEN they SHALL explain why, not what
4. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN it SHALL be generated from code annotations
5. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN it SHALL provide clear guidance for new developers

### Requirement 12: Validate Enhanced Pattern System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced pattern system to be robust and well-validated so that it can reliably handle complex pattern operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patterns are loaded THEN the enhanced loader SHALL handle all pattern types correctly
2. WHEN pattern validation occurs THEN it SHALL use appropriate schemas for each pattern type
3. WHEN pattern enhancement is performed THEN it SHALL maintain data integrity
4. WHEN pattern operations fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
