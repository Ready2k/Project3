# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JIRA integration is ignoring the "Verify SSL" settings when using username and password authentication. Users report that even when they uncheck "Verify SSL Certificates" in the configuration, the system still attempts to verify SSL certificates, causing connection failures for self-signed certificates or internal servers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user configuring JIRA integration with username/password authentication, I want the "Verify SSL Certificates" setting to be respected, so that I can connect to JIRA servers with self-signed certificates or internal CA certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I uncheck "Verify SSL Certificates" in the JIRA configuration THEN the system SHALL disable SSL certificate verification for all JIRA API calls
2. WHEN I check "Verify SSL Certificates" in the JIRA configuration THEN the system SHALL enable SSL certificate verification for all JIRA API calls
3. WHEN using username/password authentication THEN the SSL verification setting SHALL be applied consistently across all authentication methods
4. WHEN the SSL verification setting is changed THEN the new setting SHALL take effect immediately for subsequent API calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging JIRA SSL issues, I want the code to be clean and consistent, so that there are no duplicate configuration assignments that could cause unexpected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JIRA configuration is built THEN each configuration parameter SHALL be set only once
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN there SHALL be no duplicate lines that assign the same configuration value multiple times
3. WHEN the SSL handler is initialized THEN it SHALL receive the correct verify_ssl value from the configuration
4. WHEN HTTP clients are created THEN they SHALL use the SSL configuration consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with self-signed certificates or internal CA certificates, I want clear feedback about SSL configuration options, so that I can properly configure the system for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSL verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about SSL certificate issues
2. WHEN SSL verification is disabled THEN the system SHALL show a warning about security implications
3. WHEN SSL configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN testing the connection THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether SSL verification is enabled or disabled
