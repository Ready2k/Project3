# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated AI Assessment (AAA) system currently designs agentic agent roles through LLM prompts when multi-agent systems are recommended, but these designed agent roles are not displayed or explained in the Analysis screen UI. When the system determines that agentic solutions can be used, users need to see the specific agent roles that were designed, understand their responsibilities and capabilities, and ensure the recommended tech stack can support the deployment, execution, and management of these agents. This feature will bridge the gap between backend agent design and frontend user visibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to see the specific agent roles designed by the system when agentic solutions are recommended, so that I can understand what autonomous agents will be created and their individual responsibilities.

2. WHEN agent roles are displayed THEN each agent SHALL show its role name, primary responsibility, and autonomy level (0.0-1.0)
3. WHEN agent capabilities are shown THEN the system SHALL list specific capabilities and decision-making authority for each agent
4. WHEN agent interactions are relevant THEN the system SHALL display communication requirements and coordination mechanisms between agents
5. WHEN exception handling is designed THEN the system SHALL show how each agent handles exceptions and edge cases autonomously

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want to understand the learning capabilities and adaptation mechanisms of each designed agent, so that I can plan for continuous improvement and system evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent roles are displayed THEN each agent SHALL show its learning capabilities and adaptation mechanisms
2. WHEN self-monitoring is included THEN the system SHALL explain how agents monitor their own performance
3. WHEN feedback loops are designed THEN the system SHALL describe how agents incorporate feedback for improvement
4. WHEN knowledge sharing is relevant THEN the system SHALL show how agents share learnings with other agents in the system
5. WHEN performance metrics are defined THEN the system SHALL list key performance indicators for each agent role

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system implementer, I want the tech stack recommendations to explicitly support the deployment and management of the designed agents, so that I can ensure the recommended technologies can actually execute the agentic solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agentic solutions are recommended THEN the tech stack SHALL include agent deployment frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI, etc.)
2. WHEN multi-agent systems are designed THEN the tech stack SHALL include agent orchestration and communication technologies
3. WHEN agent reasoning is required THEN the tech stack SHALL include reasoning engines and knowledge management systems
4. WHEN agent monitoring is needed THEN the tech stack SHALL include observability and performance monitoring tools for agents
5. WHEN agent learning is designed THEN the tech stack SHALL include machine learning and adaptation frameworks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see the coordination and communication patterns between agents, so that I can understand the complexity and dependencies in the multi-agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents are designed THEN the system SHALL display agent interaction patterns and communication protocols
2. WHEN hierarchical structures exist THEN the system SHALL show the agent hierarchy and reporting relationships
3. WHEN coordination mechanisms are needed THEN the system SHALL explain how agents coordinate their activities
4. WHEN conflict resolution is designed THEN the system SHALL describe how agents resolve conflicts or competing objectives
5. WHEN workflow distribution is relevant THEN the system SHALL show how work is distributed among different agents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to understand the decision boundaries and autonomy levels of each agent, so that I can assess the risk and control mechanisms in the agentic solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent decision-making is displayed THEN each agent SHALL show its decision boundaries and what decisions it can make independently
2. WHEN autonomy levels are shown THEN the system SHALL explain what the autonomy score means for each agent (0.0-1.0 scale)
3. WHEN escalation paths exist THEN the system SHALL show when and how agents escalate issues to humans or other agents
4. WHEN safety mechanisms are designed THEN the system SHALL display safeguards and constraints for each agent
5. WHEN approval workflows are needed THEN the system SHALL show which agent decisions require approval or validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to see how agents handle sensitive data and maintain audit trails, so that I can ensure the agentic solution meets regulatory and governance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents handle sensitive data THEN the system SHALL show data protection and privacy measures for each agent
2. WHEN audit requirements exist THEN the system SHALL display how agents maintain audit trails and decision logs
3. WHEN compliance controls are needed THEN the system SHALL show how agents enforce business rules and compliance requirements
4. WHEN data governance is relevant THEN the system SHALL explain how agents manage data access and sharing
5. WHEN regulatory reporting is required THEN the system SHALL show how agents support compliance reporting and documentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user experience designer, I want the agent roles display to be intuitive and well-organized, so that users can easily understand the complex multi-agent system design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent roles are displayed THEN the UI SHALL use clear visual hierarchy and organization to present agent information
2. WHEN multiple agents exist THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and grouping options (by role type, autonomy level, etc.)
3. WHEN agent details are shown THEN the system SHALL use expandable sections to manage information density
4. WHEN agent interactions are complex THEN the system SHALL provide visual diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate relationships
5. WHEN technical details are extensive THEN the system SHALL provide both summary and detailed views for different user types

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see deployment and operational requirements for each agent, so that I can plan infrastructure and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent deployment is planned THEN the system SHALL show infrastructure requirements for each agent (compute, memory, storage)
2. WHEN operational needs are assessed THEN the system SHALL display monitoring and maintenance requirements for each agent
3. WHEN scaling is considered THEN the system SHALL show how agents can be scaled up or down based on workload
4. WHEN integration is needed THEN the system SHALL list external systems and APIs each agent needs to access
5. WHEN security is relevant THEN the system SHALL show authentication and authorization requirements for each agent

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see implementation guidance for each agent role, so that I can understand how to build and deploy the designed agentic solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementation planning begins THEN the system SHALL provide code examples or pseudocode for key agent functions
2. WHEN framework selection is needed THEN the system SHALL recommend specific agentic frameworks best suited for each agent role
3. WHEN integration patterns are required THEN the system SHALL show how agents integrate with existing systems and data sources
4. WHEN testing is planned THEN the system SHALL provide testing strategies and validation approaches for each agent
5. WHEN deployment is considered THEN the system SHALL offer deployment templates and configuration examples

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want to understand how the agentic solution maintains quality and handles errors, so that I can assess system reliability and robustness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality control is designed THEN the system SHALL show how agents validate their own outputs and decisions
2. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL display error recovery and fallback mechanisms for each agent
3. WHEN quality metrics are defined THEN the system SHALL list quality indicators and success criteria for each agent
4. WHEN validation processes exist THEN the system SHALL show how agents cross-validate decisions with other agents or systems
5. WHEN continuous improvement is planned THEN the system SHALL explain how agents learn from errors and improve over time
