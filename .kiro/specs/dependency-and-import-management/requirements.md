# Dependency and Import Management Specification

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical dependency and import management issues identified in the AAA codebase. The system currently suffers from widespread use of fallback imports, circular dependencies, and inconsistent dependency handling that leads to unpredictable behavior and difficult debugging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Fallback Import Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all imports to be explicit and predictable so that I can understand dependencies and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL NOT use any try/except import patterns for core functionality
2. WHEN a required dependency is missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with a clear error message
3. WHEN optional features are unavailable THEN they SHALL be disabled through configuration, not import failures
4. WHEN imports are used THEN they SHALL follow the standard library → third-party → local pattern consistently
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN zero fallback imports SHALL remain in the codebase

### Requirement 2: Implement Service Registry Pattern

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized service registry so that I can manage dependencies consistently and enable proper testing with mocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are needed THEN they SHALL be obtained through the service registry
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all required services SHALL be registered and validated
3. WHEN tests run THEN mock services SHALL be easily substituted through the registry
4. WHEN services have dependencies THEN they SHALL be resolved automatically by the registry
5. WHEN the registry is implemented THEN it SHALL support both singleton and factory patterns

### Requirement 3: Add Comprehensive Type Hints

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase so that I can catch errors early and understand interfaces clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL include type hints for all parameters and return values
2. WHEN classes are defined THEN they SHALL include type hints for all attributes and methods
3. WHEN the type checking runs THEN it SHALL pass without errors using mypy
4. WHEN complex types are used THEN they SHALL be properly defined using typing module constructs
5. WHEN the type hints are complete THEN IDE support SHALL provide accurate autocompletion and error detection

### Requirement 4: Create Dependency Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate all dependencies at startup so that I can identify missing or incompatible packages before runtime failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all required dependencies are available
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
3. WHEN dependency versions are incompatible THEN the system SHALL warn about potential issues
4. WHEN optional dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL log which features are disabled
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN a dependency report SHALL be available for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5: Implement Proper Error Handling for Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for dependency issues so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN import errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and converted to meaningful application errors
2. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation where possible
3. WHEN critical services fail THEN the system SHALL fail fast with actionable error messages
4. WHEN dependency errors are logged THEN they SHALL include context about the failing operation
5. WHEN errors are handled THEN they SHALL follow the standardized error handling patterns

### Requirement 6: Create Dependency Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of all dependencies and their purposes so that I can understand the system architecture and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be documented with their purpose and alternatives
2. WHEN the documentation is created THEN it SHALL include dependency graphs and relationships
3. WHEN optional dependencies exist THEN their impact on functionality SHALL be clearly documented
4. WHEN version constraints exist THEN the reasons SHALL be documented
5. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN it SHALL be automatically generated from code annotations

## Success Criteria

The dependency and import management effort will be considered successful when:

1. **Zero Fallback Imports**: No try/except import patterns remain in the codebase
2. **Service Registry**: All components use the service registry for dependency resolution
3. **Type Safety**: Full type hint coverage with mypy validation passing
4. **Dependency Validation**: Startup validation catches all dependency issues
5. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive dependency documentation is available

## Constraints

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must be preserved during migration
2. **Performance**: Dependency resolution must not significantly impact startup time
3. **Testing**: All changes must be covered by appropriate tests
4. **Incremental Migration**: Changes must be deliverable in phases to allow validation
5. **Documentation**: All new patterns must be documented for team adoption

## Dependencies

1. **Service Registry Implementation**: Core registry must be implemented before migration
2. **Type Checking Tools**: mypy and related tools must be configured
3. **Testing Framework**: Dependency injection testing patterns must be established
4. **Documentation Tools**: Automated documentation generation must be available
5. **Configuration System**: New configuration system must support service registration
