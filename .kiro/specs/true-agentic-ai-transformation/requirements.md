# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification transforms the Automated AI Assessment (AAA) system from a traditional automation assessment tool into a True Agentic AI Assessment platform. The system will prioritize autonomous agent solutions that can reason, plan, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows independently. Instead of recommending human-in-the-loop processes or traditional automation, the system will focus on AI agents that can operate with minimal human intervention while handling exceptions through reasoning rather than escalation.
