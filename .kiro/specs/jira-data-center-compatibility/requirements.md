# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures compatibility with Jira Data Center version 9.12.22, addressing specific API differences, authentication methods, and deployment considerations that differ from Jira Cloud. The system currently uses Jira REST API v3 which is supported in Data Center 9.12.22, but requires additional configuration options and enhanced error handling for on-premises deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the AAA system to work with our on-premises Jira Data Center 9.12.22 instance, so that we can integrate with our internal ticketing system without relying on cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Jira integration THEN the system SHALL support both Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center base URLs
2. WHEN connecting to Jira Data Center THEN the system SHALL validate SSL certificates appropriately for self-signed or internal CA certificates
3. WHEN authenticating with Jira Data Center THEN the system SHALL support both API tokens and Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
4. IF the base URL contains a custom port THEN the system SHALL handle non-standard port configurations correctly
5. WHEN testing connection THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages for Data Center-specific issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle Jira Data Center API differences gracefully, so that ticket fetching works reliably across different Jira deployment types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching tickets from Data Center THEN the system SHALL handle potential API response format differences
2. WHEN parsing ticket data THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing or differently structured fields in Data Center responses
3. IF API rate limiting is encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN encountering Data Center-specific error codes THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN processing custom fields THEN the system SHALL handle Data Center custom field configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to support our enterprise authentication and network security requirements, so that Jira integration complies with our security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting through corporate proxies THEN the system SHALL support HTTP/HTTPS proxy configuration
2. WHEN using internal certificates THEN the system SHALL support custom CA certificate bundles
3. IF network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL provide configurable timeout settings for enterprise networks
4. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support enterprise SSO integration where applicable
5. WHEN logging security events THEN the system SHALL log authentication attempts and connection details appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive configuration options for Jira Data Center deployment scenarios, so that the system works in various enterprise network environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring base URL THEN the system SHALL validate and normalize Data Center URL formats
2. WHEN detecting Jira version THEN the system SHALL identify Data Center vs Cloud deployments automatically
3. IF custom context paths are used THEN the system SHALL handle non-root Jira installations
4. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on Data Center authentication options
5. WHEN testing connectivity THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive health checks for Data Center environments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback and troubleshooting information when Jira Data Center integration issues occur, so that I can quickly resolve configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps for Data Center issues
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different authentication failure types
3. IF version incompatibility is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear version requirement information
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide network-specific diagnostic information
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step configuration guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with Jira Data Center using my current session or Windows login credentials, so that I don't need to manage separate API tokens and can leverage existing enterprise authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Jira Data Center THEN the system SHALL attempt SSO authentication using current session details first
2. WHEN SSO authentication is available THEN the system SHALL use Windows login credentials or current browser session
3. IF SSO authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback option to basic authentication
4. WHEN using basic authentication fallback THEN the system SHALL prompt for username and password
5. WHEN storing basic authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL store them securely only for the current session
6. WHEN basic credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL use them only for Jira API calls and not persist them permanently
7. IF both SSO and basic authentication fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on authentication options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing Jira Cloud integrations, so that current users are not affected by Data Center support additions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing Jira Cloud configurations THEN the system SHALL continue to work without changes
2. WHEN switching between Cloud and Data Center THEN the system SHALL handle configuration differences transparently
3. IF API responses differ between versions THEN the system SHALL normalize data consistently
4. WHEN upgrading the system THEN existing Jira integrations SHALL continue to function
5. WHEN configuring new integrations THEN the system SHALL auto-detect deployment type where possible
