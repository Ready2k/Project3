# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and fix confidence level extraction
  - Investigate current confidence calculation logic in RecommendationService
  - Identify where LLM confidence values are being lost or overridden
  - Add comprehensive logging to trace confidence value flow
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Enhance LLM confidence parsing and validation
  - Improve `_calculate_confidence` method to properly extract LLM confidence
  - Add robust validation for confidence values (0.0-1.0 range)
  - Implement fallback mechanisms when LLM confidence is invalid
  - Add detailed logging for confidence source tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [x] 3. Fix pattern creation decision logic
  - Analyze `_should_create_new_pattern` method in RecommendationService
  - Identify why new patterns aren't being created despite novel technologies
  - Implement technology novelty scoring separate from conceptual similarity
  - Add decision logging for pattern creation rationale
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Implement enhanced pattern creation algorithm
  - Modify pattern creation logic to consider technology novelty
  - Ensure new patterns are created when technology stack is significantly different
  - Validate pattern creation doesn't duplicate existing pattern IDs
  - Add comprehensive error handling for pattern creation failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.5_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive testing for confidence extraction
  - Create unit tests for various LLM confidence formats
  - Test edge cases (invalid values, missing confidence, malformed JSON)
  - Test pattern-based confidence fallback mechanisms
  - Verify confidence display formatting in UI
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive testing for pattern creation
  - Create unit tests for pattern creation decision logic
  - Test scenarios with novel technologies vs conceptual similarity
  - Verify pattern creation audit logging
  - Test pattern validation and duplicate prevention
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 7. Integrate and validate end-to-end functionality
  - Test complete flow from LLM analysis to confidence display
  - Verify pattern creation works with real requirements containing new technologies
  - Validate logging and monitoring for both fixes
  - Perform regression testing to ensure no existing functionality is broken
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
