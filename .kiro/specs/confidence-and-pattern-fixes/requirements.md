# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical issues in the AAA system: hardcoded confidence levels that always show 85.00% instead of using LLM-generated confidence values, and the pattern library not creating new patterns despite having new technologies that should warrant pattern creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Confidence Level Extraction

**User Story:** As a user analyzing requirements, I want to see accurate confidence levels from the LLM analysis, so that I can trust the feasibility assessment quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM generates a confidence level THEN the system SHALL extract and display the actual LLM confidence value
2. WHEN the LLM confidence is not available THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence using pattern-based algorithms
3. WHEN displaying confidence levels THEN the system SHALL show values that vary based on actual analysis quality
4. WHEN the confidence is extracted from LLM response THEN the system SHALL validate it's between 0.0 and 1.0
5. WHEN the confidence is displayed in the UI THEN the system SHALL format it as a percentage with appropriate precision

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Pattern Creation Logic

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want new patterns to be created when requirements contain novel technologies or approaches, so that the pattern library stays current and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing requirements with new technologies THEN the system SHALL create new patterns instead of only enhancing existing ones
2. WHEN the conceptual similarity score is below the threshold THEN the system SHALL proceed with new pattern creation
3. WHEN new patterns are created THEN the system SHALL include all relevant technologies from the requirements
4. WHEN pattern creation is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the decision rationale for audit purposes
5. WHEN new patterns are saved THEN the system SHALL validate they don't duplicate existing pattern IDs

###ystem SHALL log the extracted values for debugging Requirement 3: Improved LLM Response Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust parsing of LLM responses for confidence and pattern data, so that the system handles various response formats reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing LLM responses THEN the system SHALL handle both JSON and text formats
2. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL attempt text extraction with fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN confidence values are extracted THEN the system SHALL validate numeric ranges and formats
4. WHEN LLM responses contain malformed data THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback values
5. WHEN parsing succeeds THEN the s
