- `GET /user-education/educational-content` - Retrieve educational content
- `GET /user-education/acceptable-examples` - Get example requests
- `GET /user-education/system-documentation` - Full system documentation
- `POST /user-education/appeals` - Submit appeal requests
- `GET /user-education/appeals/{id}` - Check appeal status
- `GET /user-education/appeals` - List pending appeals (admin)
- `PUT /user-education/appeals/{id}` - Process appeals (admin)
- `GET /user-education/stats` - System statistics
- `GET /user-education/health` - Health check

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
