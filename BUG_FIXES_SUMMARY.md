# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ LLM Messages showing 'Purpose: unknown'

**Problem**: All LLM messages in the audit trail were showing 'Purpose: unknown' instead of meaningful purposes.

**Root Cause**: The audit logging system didn't have a purpose field, and LLM calls weren't passing purpose information.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `purpose` field to `AuditRun` dataclass in `app/utils/audit.py`
- Updated database schema to include `purpose` column with migration support
- Modified `log_llm_call()` function to accept and store purpose parameter
- Updated `AuditedLLMProvider` to pass purpose from kwargs to audit logging
- Added purpose tracking to all LLM calls:
  - `question_generation` - for Q&A question generation
  - `answer_analysis` - for analyzing user answers
  - `tech_stack_generation` - for generating technology recommendations
  - `tech_stack_explanation` - for architecture explanations
  - `diagram_generation` - for Mermaid diagram generation

**Result**: LLM messages now show meaningful purposes like "tech_stack_generation", "question_generation", etc.

### 2. ✅ Export JSON error with 'Partial' feasibility

**Problem**: Export was failing with validation error: `'Partial' is not one of ['Automatable', 'Partially Automatable', 'Not Automatable', 'Unknown']`

**Root Cause**: The recommendation service was using inconsistent feasibility values ("Yes", "Partial", "No") instead of the schema-compliant values.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `RecommendationService._determine_feasibility()` to return proper values:
  - "Yes" → "Automatable"
  - "Partial" → "Partially Automatable" 
  - "No" → "Not Automatable"
- Fixed feasibility multiplier mapping in confidence calculation
- Updated reasoning generation to handle "Partially Automatable" instead of "Partial"
- Updated method documentation to reflect correct return values

**Result**: JSON export now works correctly with schema-compliant feasibility values.

### 3. ✅ Markdown export download button not working

**Problem**: The markdown export showed a markdown link instead of a proper download button, which didn't work.

**Root Cause**: The export functionality was using `st.markdown()` with a link instead of `st.download_button()`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `export_results()` method in `streamlit_app.py`
- Added proper file content retrieval via HTTP request to the export endpoint
- Implemented `st.download_button()` with actual file content
- Added fallback to markdown link if download button creation fails
- Proper MIME type and filename handling

**Result**: Export buttons now provide proper file downloads for both JSON and Markdown formats.

### 4. ✅ Tech Stack Components and High-Level Description Prompts Now Visible

**Problem**: The tech stack generation and architecture explanation prompts weren't visible in the LLM message audit trail.

**Root Cause**: These LLM calls weren't being properly tracked with meaningful purposes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `purpose="tech_stack_generation"` to tech stack generator LLM calls
- Added `purpose="tech_stack_explanation"` to architecture explainer LLM calls
- Updated audit integration to properly pass purpose through the call chain
- Enhanced LLM message display to show purpose-specific information

**Result**: You can now see the prompts that ask for tech stack components and high-level architecture descriptions in the LLM Messages section with proper purpose labels.

## Technical Details

### Database Migration
The audit database automatically migrates to add the `purpose` column when the application starts. Existing installations will seamlessly upgrade.

### Backward Compatibility
- Old feasibility values in the UI are still handled correctly
- Existing audit records without purpose show "unknown" as before
- Export validation accepts both old and new feasibility formats during transition

### Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_fix_verification.py`) that verifies:
- Feasibility values are schema-compliant
- Audit logging includes purpose field
- Export validation accepts correct feasibility values

## Verification

Run the verification test:
```bash
python3 test_fix_verification.py
```

All tests should pass, confirming the fixes are working correctly.

## Files Modified

1. `app/utils/audit.py` - Added purpose field and database migration
2. `app/utils/audit_integration.py` - Updated to pass purpose parameter
3. `app/services/recommendation.py` - Fixed feasibility value consistency
4. `app/services/architecture_explainer.py` - Added purpose to LLM calls
5. `app/services/tech_stack_generator.py` - Added purpose to LLM calls
6. `app/qa/question_loop.py` - Added purpose to LLM calls
7. `streamlit_app.py` - Fixed export download functionality and added purpose to diagram generation
8. `test_fix_verification.py` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Impact

- ✅ LLM audit trail now provides meaningful categorization of different types of AI calls
- ✅ Export functionality works reliably for both JSON and Markdown formats
- ✅ All feasibility assessments are consistent and schema-compliant
- ✅ Better observability into AI system behavior and decision-making process
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with proper download functionality
