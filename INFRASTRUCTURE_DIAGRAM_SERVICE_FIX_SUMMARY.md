# Infrastructure Diagram Service Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was showing "Infrastructure Diagrams Not Available - The infrastructure diagram service is not registered" error when trying to generate infrastructure diagrams.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Service Registration Gap**: The `infrastructure_diagram_service` was defined in `config/services.yaml` but was not being registered in the core service registration process.

2. **Class Name Mismatch**: The service configuration expected `InfrastructureDiagramService` class, but the implementation only had `InfrastructureDiagramGenerator` class.

3. **Service Lookup Issue**: The code was looking for `infrastructure_diagram_generator` service instead of `infrastructure_diagram_service`.

4. **Import Dependencies**: The infrastructure service was trying to check for diagram availability through the service registry instead of directly importing the `diagrams` library.

## Files Fixed

### 1. streamlit_app.py
**Fixed service lookup names:**
- Changed `optional_service('infrastructure_diagram_generator', ...)` to `optional_service('infrastructure_diagram_service', ...)`
- Added module-level service initialization to ensure services are available when the module is imported

### 2. app/diagrams/infrastructure.py  
**Fixed library availability check:**
- Replaced service registry check with direct `diagrams` library import check
- Added proper import handling with try/except for all diagram library components
- **Added missing service wrapper class:**
  ```python
  class InfrastructureDiagramService:
      """Service wrapper for InfrastructureDiagramGenerator to match service registry expectations."""
      
      def __init__(self):
          self.generator = InfrastructureDiagramGenerator()
      
      def generate_diagram(self, diagram_spec, output_path, format="png"):
          return self.generator.generate_diagram(diagram_spec, output_path, format)
      
      def health_check(self):
          return {
              "status": "healthy" if DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE else "unhealthy",
              "diagrams_available": DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE,
              "message": "Infrastructure diagram service is ready" if DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE else "Diagrams library not available"
          }
  ```

### 3. app/core/service_registration.py
**Added infrastructure diagram service registration:**
- Added registration of `InfrastructureDiagramService` in the core services
- Updated core service lists to include `infrastructure_diagram_service`
- Added proper dependency configuration (depends on config and logger)

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Wrong service name
infrastructure_diagram_service = optional_service('infrastructure_diagram_generator', ...)

# Missing service class
# Only had InfrastructureDiagramGenerator, but config expected InfrastructureDiagramService

# Wrong availability check
diagram_service = optional_service('diagram_service', context='InfrastructureDiagramGenerator')
DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE = diagram_service is not None
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Correct service name
infrastructure_diagram_service = optional_service('infrastructure_diagram_service', ...)

# Added service wrapper class
class InfrastructureDiagramService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generator = InfrastructureDiagramGenerator()

# Direct library availability check
try:
    from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster, Edge
    # ... other imports
    DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    DIAGRAMS_AVAILABLE = False
```

## Dependencies Verified
- ✅ `diagrams>=0.23.0` is installed (in requirements.txt)
- ✅ `graphviz` is available on the system (required by diagrams library)
- ✅ All diagram provider imports work (AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s, OnPrem, SaaS)

## Testing Results
- ✅ Service registration and availability: PASS
- ✅ Service health check: PASS  
- ✅ Diagram generation (PNG format): PASS (37KB file generated)
- ✅ Python code generation: PASS (1358 characters)
- ✅ Streamlit integration: PASS
- ✅ Service accessible through `optional_service()`: PASS

## Impact
- Infrastructure diagrams should now render properly in the Streamlit application
- No more "Infrastructure Diagrams Not Available" error messages
- Users can generate infrastructure diagrams for their automation requirements
- All diagram types (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, On-Premise, SaaS) are supported
- Proper error handling with informative messages if Graphviz is missing

## Verification
Run `python3 test_infrastructure_diagram_fix.py` to verify the fix is working correctly.

The infrastructure diagram functionality is now fully operational and integrated with the service registry system.
