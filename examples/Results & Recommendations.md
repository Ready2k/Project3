📋 Original Requirements
Description: As a BFA System I want an account that is marked as deceased and has an active care case to be marked as &amp;#x27;Deceased Care DNP&amp;#x27; and moved into Do Not Pursue

Domain: customer-service

Pattern Types: workflow

🚫 Applied Constraints:

• Banned Technologies: FASTAI

• Required Integrations: Amazon Connect

• Compliance: GDPR

• Budget: Low (Open source preferred)

Data Sources: physical letters in a filing cabinet -

Decision Complexity: my manager says what to do

Integrations: we just use it as a phone system

Data Availability: when a letter comes in we read it and [REMOVED_SUSPICIOUS_CONTENT]the filed copy and then send a letter back out to the customer

Llm Analysis Automation Feasibility: Not Automatable

Llm Analysis Feasibility Reasoning: The requirement fundamentally involves processing physical letters and decisions based on manager instructions, which are inherently non-digital and cannot be automated through software agents without digital inputs or decision criteria.

Llm Analysis Key Insights: ['The process relies heavily on physical documents (letters) which are not digitally accessible.', 'Decisions are based on manager instructions, indicating non-standardized inputs not suitable for automation.', 'Required integrations and workflow do not provide sufficient digital entry points for an agent to operate.']

Llm Analysis Automation Challenges: ['Lack of digital data inputs due to reliance on physical letters.', 'Non-standardized decision-making process based on human judgment.', 'Limited integration points for agents to interact with the system, as Amazon Connect is used minimally.']

Llm Analysis Recommended Approach: Implement a digital document management system to capture and digitize incoming letters, coupled with defined decision rules to facilitate future automation possibilities.

Llm Analysis Confidence Level: 0.85

Llm Analysis Next Steps: ['Explore solutions for digitizing incoming physical documents for a seamless digital process.', 'Define clear and standardized decision-making rules that can be translated into automated processes.']

🏗️ Agentic Architecture Flow
How your AI agents will work together:

To address the requirement of marking an account as 'Deceased Care DNP' and managing its movement without pursuing further actions, the proposed technology stack is integrated to ensure seamless automation and data handling in a customer-service domain with minimal cost. The heart of this infrastructure is Node.js, paired with Express.js, which provides an efficient, non-blocking, and scalable server environment necessary for handling requests related to account status updates. Node.js interacts with a RESTful API designed using OpenAPI specifications, enabling different components to communicate in a standardized manner, ensuring that microservices can interact seamlessly, even when scaled or altered.

Data handling and persistent storage are managed by MongoDB, which offers a flexible, document-based data model great for handling dynamic schemas like customer details and account statuses. MongoDB stores account data, care case information, and the 'Do Not Pursue' status, working closely with ElasticSearch. ElasticSearch is crucial here for efficiently indexing and querying customer-service data, enabling rapid searches of accounts based on status, such as the deceased label, and subsequently initiating processes to update statuses.

To handle compliance and data workflows, Jenkins provides continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities, automating the building, testing, and deploying of the application changes. Docker containers encapsulate the app and its environment, ensuring consistent deployments across all servers while Kubernetes orchestrates these containers, ensuring scalable, efficient resource allocation and management. For phone system integration, Twilio works alongside Amazon Connect, enabling seamless retrieval and processing of call tasks related to deceased account management. Amazon S3 handles data storage such as call recordings or logs, vital for compliance and audit trails adhering to GDPR regulations. This stack, designed with open-source components, ensures a cost-effective solution while providing a robust communication and data management platform tailored for the specific requirement.
