## Bug Fix Request: Feasibility Assessment Not Updating

### Problem Description
The AAA (Automated AI Assessment) system has a critical bug where the feasibility status remains "‚ö™ Feasibility: Unknown" and "Assessment pending" even after successful completion of the full analysis workflow.

### Bug Details
**Session ID with Bug:** 3c4bb8f9-b6ad-4e4b-8868-a28581b6786d

**Symptoms:**
- Analysis phase shows "DONE (100%)" ‚úÖ
- Processing shows "‚ú® Processing complete!" ‚úÖ  
- Key insights, challenges, and recommendations are generated ‚úÖ
- Confidence level calculated (85%) ‚úÖ
- **Feasibility status stuck at "Unknown"** ‚ùå
- **Assessment shows "Assessment pending"** ‚ùå

**Expected Behavior:**
With 85% confidence and comprehensive recommendations, should display proper feasibility status like:
- "üü¢ Feasibility: Highly Feasible" or 
- "üü° Feasibility: Partially Feasible"

### Technical Context
- System: Automated AI Assessment (AAA) - Streamlit + FastAPI application
- LLM Provider: OpenAI GPT-4o
- Analysis Type: Customer support automation requirements
- All analysis phases completed successfully but feasibility calculation logic failed

### Investigation Needed
1. Check the feasibility assessment calculation logic in the analysis workflow
2. Identify where feasibility status should be set after analysis completion
3. Debug the connection between analysis results and feasibility display
4. Ensure proper state management for session feasibility updates

### Files to Examine
Look for feasibility-related code in:
- Analysis workflow components
- Session state management
- Results display logic
- Recommendation generation pipeline

### Fix Requirements
- Feasibility status should update automatically when analysis completes
- Status should reflect the confidence level and recommendation quality
- Fix should handle existing sessions with the bug
- Ensure proper error handling for future feasibility calculations

### Test Case
Use session ID 3c4bb8f9-b6ad-4e4b-8868-a28581b6786d to reproduce and verify the fix works for completed analyses.
