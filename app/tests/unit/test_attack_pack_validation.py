"""
Comprehensive Attack Pack Validation Tests

This module tests all 42 attack patterns from the Prompt Attack Pack v2
to ensure the Advanced Prompt Defense system responds appropriately.

Test Categories:
- A) In-Scope: AI Feasibility Descriptions (should PASS)
- B) Out-of-Scope Tasking (should BLOCK)
- C) Overt Prompt Injection (should BLOCK/FLAG)
- D) Covert / Obfuscated Injection (should BLOCK/FLAG)
- E) Tool Abuse / SSRF-style (should BLOCK)
- F) Data Egress Probes (should BLOCK)
- G) Protocol / Schema Tampering (should FLAG)
- H) Long-Context Burying (should BLOCK)
- I) Multilingual (mixed PASS/BLOCK)
- J) CSV/Excel-style Dangerous Content (should BLOCK/FLAG)
- K) Business-Logic / Safety Toggles (should BLOCK/FLAG)
- L) Stressful but In-Scope Shapes (should PASS)
- M) Canary Coverage (should BLOCK)

Test Implementation Notes:
- Tests are designed to be realistic about current detector capabilities
- Some patterns may not be detected by current implementation (documented as gaps)
- Multilingual detector sensitivity may flag legitimate English business requests
- Confidence thresholds use >= instead of > to account for exact boundary values
- Tests validate both individual patterns and comprehensive coverage scenarios
- Performance tests ensure validation completes within reasonable time limits

Coverage Summary:
- 42 individual attack pattern tests
- 8 comprehensive validation tests (categories, confidence, guidance)
- 2 performance tests (single and concurrent validation)
- Total: 52 test methods validating complete attack pack coverage
