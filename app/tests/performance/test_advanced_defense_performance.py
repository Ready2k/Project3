Performance Testing for Advanced Prompt Attack Defense

This module provides comprehensive performance testing for the advanced prompt
attack defense system, focusing on production readiness benchmarks.

Performance Requirements:
- Single request validation: < 100ms (target: < 50ms)
- Throughput: > 20 requests/second
- Memory usage: Stable under sustained load
- Concurrent processing: Efficient parallel detection
- Scaling: Reasonable performance with input length

Test Categories:
1. Single request latency benchmarks
2. Throughput and concurrent processing tests
3. Memory usage and stability tests
4. Scaling behavior with input characteristics
5. Performance regression detection
6. Resource utilization optimization tests
