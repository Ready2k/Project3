# Bug Fix Summary - August 22, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Jira Integration Agent Name Problem
**Issue**: When fetching Jira tickets, all agents in the Agent Team & Interaction Flow diagrams had the same generic information:
- All agents named "Primary Autonomous Agent" 
- Agent summaries, status, and priority all coming from Jira metadata
- Made diagrams less useful and harder to understand

**Root Cause**: 
- Jira integration was including too many fields (priority, status, assignee, etc.) in requirements
- Agent generation was using hardcoded "Primary Autonomous Agent" name
- Jira metadata was polluting the agent generation logic

**Fix**:
- Simplified Jira integration to only use summary + description
- Implemented dynamic agent naming based on requirement content
- Added intelligent domain detection (User Management Agent, Communication Agent, etc.)
- Applied fix to all agent creation methods

### 2. Claude Adding Explanations to Mermaid Code
**Issue**: Claude sometimes adds explanatory text despite being asked for "only the mermaid code":
- Responses like "Here's the diagram for your requirement:" before code
- Explanations after diagrams breaking Mermaid syntax
- Inconsistent response formats causing rendering failures

**Root Cause**:
- LLMs naturally want to explain their output
- Existing prompts weren't explicit enough about code-only responses
- No extraction logic to handle mixed responses

**Fix**:
- Added robust Mermaid code extraction from mixed responses
- Enhanced all diagram generation prompts with explicit "no explanations" instructions
- Implemented pattern matching to identify and extract valid Mermaid code
- Added validation to ensure extracted code is actually Mermaid syntax

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `app/services/jira.py`: Simplified ticket mapping, removed metadata pollution
- `app/services/agentic_recommendation_service.py`: Dynamic agent naming system
- `streamlit_app.py`: Enhanced Mermaid code extraction and prompt improvements
- `.kiro/steering/recent-improvements.md`: Updated documentation

### Key Functions Added/Enhanced
- `_generate_agent_name()`: Intelligent agent naming based on requirement content
- `_extract_mermaid_code()`: Robust extraction of Mermaid code from mixed responses
- `_looks_like_mermaid_code()`: Validation of extracted code
- Enhanced `_clean_mermaid_code()`: Now calls extraction first, then applies cleaning

### Testing
- Verified agent name generation with various requirement types
- Tested Mermaid code extraction with different response formats
- Confirmed backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Results

### Agent Names Now Context-Specific
- ✅ User Management Agent (for user/customer tasks)
- ✅ Communication Agent (for email/messaging)
- ✅ Analytics Agent (for reporting/metrics)
- ✅ Monitoring Agent (for system monitoring)
- ✅ Financial Processing Agent (for payments/invoices)
- ✅ And 9 more intelligent categories

### Diagram Rendering More Reliable
- ✅ Handles Claude's explanatory text automatically
- ✅ Extracts clean Mermaid code from mixed responses
- ✅ Works with all diagram types (flowchart, C4, sequence)
- ✅ Backward compatible with clean responses
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with meaningful fallbacks

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Agent diagrams now show meaningful, context-specific names
- **Reliability**: Diagram generation works consistently across all LLM providers
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation between Jira data and agent logic
- **Robustness**: System handles various LLM response formats gracefully
