# Streamlit-Mermaid Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was showing "streamlit-mermaid not available. Please install it." message even though the package was installed.

## Root Cause
The application was trying to import `streamlit_mermaid` as a service through the service registry using `optional_service('streamlit_mermaid', ...)` instead of importing it directly as a Python module.

## Solution
Changed all instances of service-based imports to direct module imports:

### Files Modified

1. **streamlit_app.py** (2 locations)
   - **Before**: `mermaid_service = optional_service('streamlit_mermaid', context='...')`
   - **After**: `import streamlit_mermaid as stmd`

2. **app/ui/analysis_display.py** (2 locations)
   - **Before**: `stmd = optional_service('streamlit_mermaid_service', context='...')`
   - **After**: `import streamlit_mermaid as stmd`

3. **app/ui/mermaid_diagrams.py** (1 location)
   - **Before**: `st_mermaid = optional_service('streamlit_mermaid_service', context='...')`
   - **After**: `from streamlit_mermaid import st_mermaid`

## Verification
- ✅ `streamlit_mermaid` package is installed (version 0.3.0)
- ✅ Direct import works correctly
- ✅ Main streamlit app imports without errors
- ✅ UI modules import without errors
- ✅ All mermaid diagram functionality should now work

## Technical Details
- The `streamlit_mermaid` package is a third-party library that should be imported directly
- It was never registered as a service in the service registry
- The service registry is for internal application services, not external packages
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with different `streamlit_mermaid` versions by handling both integer and string height parameters

## Testing
Run `python3 test_streamlit_mermaid_fix.py` to verify the fix is working correctly.

## Impact
- Mermaid diagrams should now render properly in the Streamlit UI
- No more "streamlit-mermaid not available" error messages
- All diagram types (Context, Container, Sequence, etc.) should display correctly
